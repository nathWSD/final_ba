Though Mercury\\'s magnetic field at the surface has just 1% the strength of Earth\\'s, it interacts with the magnetic field of the solar wind to sometimes create intense magnetic tornadoes that funnel the fast, hot solar wind plasma down to the surface of the planet.

The outermost layer, Earth\\'s crust, goes about 19 miles (30 kilometers) deep on average on land. At the bottom of the ocean, the crust is thinner and extends about 3 miles (5 kilometers) from the seafloor to the top of the mantle. Surface Like Mars and Venus, Earth has volcanoes, mountains, and valleys. Earth\\'s lithosphere, which includes the crust (both continental and oceanic) and the upper mantle, is divided into huge plates that are constantly moving. For example, the North American plate moves west over the Pacific Ocean basin, roughly at a rate equal to the growth of our fingernails. Earthquakes result when plates grind past one another, ride up over one another, collide to make mountains, or split and separate.\\nEarth\\'s global ocean, which covers nearly 70% of the planet\\'s surface, has an average depth of about 2.5 miles (4 kilometers) and contains 97% of Earth\\'s water. Almost all of Earth\\'s volcanoes are hidden under these oceans. Hawaii\\'s Mauna Kea volcano is taller from base to summit than Mount Everest, but most of it is underwater.

Surface Neptune does not have a solid surface. Its atmosphere (made up mostly of hydrogen, helium, and methane) extends to great depths, gradually merging into water and other melted ices over a heavier, solid core with about the same mass as Earth. Atmosphere Neptune\\'s atmosphere is made up mostly of hydrogen and helium with just a little bit of methane. Neptune\\'s neighbor Uranus has a similar makeup; the methane absorbs other colors but reflects blue, giving these ice giants their similar hue. Many images of Neptune, coming from the Voyager 2 flyby in 1989, show Neptune as a much deeper blue. This was because the Voyager team tweaked the images, to better reveal clouds and other distinctive features on the planet, compared to the hazy, uniform view of Uranus that Voyager 2 had captured in 1986. Researchers in 2024 re-processed the images , showing the planets look much more alike than many thought.\\nNeptune is our solar system\\'s windiest world. Despite its great distance and low energy input from the Sun, Neptune\\'s winds can be three times stronger than Jupiter\\'s and nine times stronger than Earth\\'s. These winds whip clouds of frozen methane across the planet at speeds of more than 1,200 miles per hour (2,000 kilometers per hour). Even Earth\\'s most powerful winds hit only about 250 miles per hour (400 kilometers per hour).\\nIn 1989 a large, oval-shaped storm in Neptune\\'s southern hemisphere dubbed the \"Great Dark Spot\" was large enough to contain the entire Earth. That storm has since disappeared, but new ones have appeared on different parts of the planet. Magnetosphere The main axis of Neptune\\'s magnetic field is tipped over by about 47 degrees compared with the planet\\'s rotation axis. Like Uranus, whose magnetic axis is tilted about 60 degrees from the axis of rotation, Neptune\\'s magnetosphere undergoes wild variations during each rotation because of this misalignment.

Mars is about half the size of Earth, and like its fellow terrestrial planets, it has a central core, a rocky mantle, and a solid crust. Structure Mars has a dense core at its center between 930 and 1,300 miles (1,500 to 2,100 kilometers) in radius. It's made of iron, nickel, and sulfur. Surrounding the core is a rocky mantle between 770 and 1,170 miles (1,240 to 1,880 kilometers) thick, and above that, a crust made of iron, magnesium, aluminum, calcium, and potassium. This crust is between 6 and 30 miles (10 to 50 kilometers) deep. Surface The Red Planet is actually many colors. At the surface, we see colors such as brown, gold, and tan. The reason Mars looks reddish is due to oxidization – or rusting – of iron in the rocks, regolith (Martian “soil”), and dust of Mars. This dust gets kicked up into the atmosphere and from a distance makes the planet appear mostly red.\\nInterestingly, while Mars is about half the diameter of Earth, its surface has nearly the same area as Earth’s dry land. Its volcanoes, impact craters, crustal movement, and atmospheric conditions such as dust storms have altered the landscape of Mars over many years, creating some of the solar system's most interesting topographical features.\\nA large canyon system called Valles Marineris is long enough to stretch from California to New York – more than 3,000 miles (4,800 kilometers). This Martian canyon is 200 miles (320 kilometers) at its widest and 4.3 miles (7 kilometers) at its deepest. That's about 10 times the size of Earth's Grand Canyon .\\nMars is home to the largest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons.

Orbit and Rotation Eris takes 557 Earth years to make one trip around the Sun. The plane of Eris' orbit is well out of the plane of the solar system's planets and extends far beyond the Kuiper Belt, a zone of icy debris beyond the orbit of Neptune.\\nAs Eris orbits the Sun, it completes one rotation every 25.9 hours, making its day length similar to ours. Moons Eris has a very small moon called Dysnomia. Dysnomia has a nearly circular orbit lasting about 16 days. This moon is named after Eris' daughter, the demon goddess of lawlessness.\\nDysnomia and other small moons around planets and dwarf planets allow astronomers to calculate the mass of the parent body. Dysnomia plays a role in determining how comparable Pluto and Eris are to each other. Rings Eris has no known rings. Formation Dwarf planet Eris is a member of a group of objects that orbit in a disc-like zone beyond the orbit of Neptune called the Kuiper Belt. This distant realm is populated with thousands of miniature icy worlds, which formed early in the history of our solar system about 4.5 billion years ago. These icy, rocky bodies are called Kuiper Belt objects, transneptunian objects, or plutoids. Structure We know very little about Eris' internal structure. Surface Eris most likely has a rocky surface similar to Pluto. Scientists think surface temperatures vary from about -359 degrees Fahrenheit (-217 degrees Celsius) to -405 degrees Fahrenheit (-243 degrees Celsius). Atmosphere The dwarf planet is often so far from the Sun that its atmosphere collapses and freezes, falling to the surface as snow. As it gets closest to the Sun in its faraway orbit, the atmosphere thaws. Magnetosphere Nothing is known about Eris' magnetosphere.\\none of nine? more or less? What is a Planet?

Structure Scientists know very little about Makemake's structure. Surface We can't see too many details of Makemake's surface from so far away, but it does appear to be a reddish-brownish color, similar to Pluto. Scientists have also detected frozen methane and ethane on its surface. In fact, pellets of frozen methane as big as half an inch (1 centimeter) in diameter may rest on Makemake's cold surface. Atmosphere Makemake may develop a very thin atmosphere, most likely made of nitrogen, near perihelion – when it is closest to the Sun. Magnetosphere Scientists do not know if Makemake has a magnetosphere.\\nKeep Exploring Discover More Topics From NASA Sun Planets Asteroids, Comets & Meteors Kuiper Belt National Aeronautics and Space Administration NASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery.\\n  * About NASA's Mission Join Us * Home * News & Events * Multimedia * NASA+ * Missions * Humans in Space * Earth * The Solar System * The Universe * Science * Aeronautics * Technology * Learning Resources * About NASA * NASA en Español Follow NASA More NASA Social Accounts NASA Newsletters Sitemap For Media Privacy Policy FOIA No FEAR Act Office of the IG Budget & Annual Reports Agency Financial Reports Contact NASA Accessibility Page Last Updated: \\nApr 24, 2025 Page Editor: \\nAMANDA BARNETT Responsible NASA Official for Science: \\nDana Bolles\\n\\n* Explore Search * News & Events ### News & Events * Recently Published * Video Series on NASA+ * Podcasts * Blogs * Newsletters * Social Media * Media Resources * Multimedia ### Multimedia * Images * Videos on NASA\",\n",

This layer is about 1,400 miles (2,300 kilometers) thick, made of iron and nickel fluids.\\nIn between the outer core and crust is the mantle, the thickest layer. This hot, viscous mixture of molten rock is about 1,800 miles (2,900 kilometers) thick and has the consistency of caramel. The outermost layer, Earth's crust, goes about 19 miles (30 kilometers) deep on average on land. At the bottom of the ocean, the crust is thinner and extends about 3 miles (5 kilometers) from the seafloor to the top of the mantle. Surface Like Mars and Venus, Earth has volcanoes, mountains, and valleys. Earth's lithosphere, which includes the crust (both continental and oceanic) and the upper mantle, is divided into huge plates that are constantly moving. For example, the North American plate moves west over the Pacific Ocean basin, roughly at a rate equal to the growth of our fingernails. Earthquakes result when plates grind past one another, ride up over one another, collide to make mountains, or split and separate.\\nEarth's global ocean, which covers nearly 70% of the planet's surface, has an average depth of about 2.5 miles (4 kilometers) and contains 97% of Earth's water. Almost all of Earth's volcanoes are hidden under these oceans. Hawaii's Mauna Kea volcano is taller from base to summit than Mount Everest, but most of it is underwater. Earth's longest mountain range is also underwater, at the bottom of the Arctic and Atlantic oceans. It is four times longer than the Andes, Rockies and Himalayas combined.

Mars is about half the size of Earth, and like its fellow terrestrial planets, it has a central core, a rocky mantle, and a solid crust. Structure Mars has a dense core at its center between 930 and 1,300 miles (1,500 to 2,100 kilometers) in radius. It's made of iron, nickel, and sulfur. Surrounding the core is a rocky mantle between 770 and 1,170 miles (1,240 to 1,880 kilometers) thick, and above that, a crust made of iron, magnesium, aluminum, calcium, and potassium. This crust is between 6 and 30 miles (10 to 50 kilometers) deep. Surface The Red Planet is actually many colors. At the surface, we see colors such as brown, gold, and tan. The reason Mars looks reddish is due to oxidization – or rusting – of iron in the rocks, regolith (Martian “soil”), and dust of Mars. This dust gets kicked up into the atmosphere and from a distance makes the planet appear mostly red.\\nInterestingly, while Mars is about half the diameter of Earth, its surface has nearly the same area as Earth’s dry land. Its volcanoes, impact craters, crustal movement, and atmospheric conditions such as dust storms have altered the landscape of Mars over many years, creating some of the solar system's most interesting topographical features.\\nA large canyon system called Valles Marineris is long enough to stretch from California to New York – more than 3,000 miles (4,800 kilometers). This Martian canyon is 200 miles (320 kilometers) at its widest and 4.3 miles (7 kilometers) at its deepest. That's about 10 times the size of Earth's Grand Canyon .\\nMars is home to the largest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons.

Mercury's exosphere is composed mostly of oxygen, sodium, hydrogen, helium, and potassium. Magnetosphere Mercury's magnetic field is offset relative to the planet's equator. Though Mercury's magnetic field at the surface has just 1% the strength of Earth's, it interacts with the magnetic field of the solar wind to sometimes create intense magnetic tornadoes that funnel the fast, hot solar wind plasma down to the surface of the planet. When the ions strike the surface, they knock off neutrally charged atoms and send them on a loop high into the sky.\\nKeep Exploring Discover More Topics From NASA Sun Planets Asteroids, Comets & Meteors Kuiper Belt National Aeronautics and Space Administration NASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery.\\n  * About NASA's Mission Join Us * Home * News & Events * Multimedia * NASA+ * Missions * Humans in Space * Earth * The Solar System * The Universe * Science * Aeronautics * Technology * Learning Resources * About NASA * NASA en Español Follow NASA More NASA Social Accounts NASA Newsletters Sitemap For Media Privacy Policy FOIA No FEAR Act Office of the IG Budget & Annual Reports Agency Financial Reports Contact NASA Accessibility Page Last Updated: \\nApr 25, 2025 Page Editor: \\nAMANDA BARNETT Responsible NASA Official for Science: \\nDana Bolles\\n\\n* Explore Search * News & Events ### News & Events * Recently Published * Video Series on NASA+ * Podcasts * Blogs * Newsletters * Social Media * Media Resources * Multimedia ### Multimedia * Images * Videos on NASA\",\n",

Orbit and Rotation Makemake takes 305 Earth years to make one trip around the Sun. As Makemake orbits the Sun, it completes one rotation every 22 and a half hours, making its day length similar to Earth and Mars. Moons This Hubble image reveals the first moon ever discovered around dwarf planet Makemake. The tiny satellite, located just above Makemake in this image, is barely visible because it is almost lost in the glare of the very bright dwarf planet.

It was the first member of the asteroid belt to be discovered when Giuseppe Piazzi spotted it in 1801. When NASA\\'s Dawn arrived in 2015, Ceres became the first dwarf planet to receive a visit from a spacecraft.\\n\\nCalled an asteroid for many years, Ceres is so much bigger and so different from its rocky neighbors that scientists classified it as a dwarf planet in 2006. Even though Ceres comprises 25% of the asteroid belt\\'s total mass, Pluto is still 14 times more massive. Namesake Ceres is named for the Roman goddess of corn and harvests. The word cereal comes from the same name. Potential for Life Ceres is one of the few places in our solar system where scientists would like to search for possible signs of life. Ceres has something a lot of other planets don\\'t: water. Here on Earth, water is essential for life, so it\\'s possible someplace else with that ingredient and a few other conditions could support life, as well. If anything does live on Ceres, it\\'s likely to be very small microbes similar to bacteria. If Ceres does not have living things today, there may be signs it harbored life in the past.

This suggests tectonic forces are slowly resurfacing Pluto.\\n\\nThe most prominent plains observed on Pluto appear to be made of frozen nitrogen gas and show no craters. These plains do show structures suggesting convection (blobs of material circulating up and down). Atmosphere Pluto has a thin, tenuous atmosphere that expands when it comes closer to the Sun and collapses as it moves farther away – similar to a comet. The main constituent is molecular nitrogen, though molecules of methane and carbon monoxide have also been detected.\\n\\nWhen Pluto is close to the Sun, its surface ices sublimate (changing directly from solid to gas) and rise to temporarily form a thin atmosphere. Pluto\\'s low gravity (about 6% of Earth\\'s) causes the atmosphere to be much more extended in altitude than our planet\\'s atmosphere. Pluto becomes much colder during the part of each year when it is traveling far away from the Sun. During this time, the bulk of the planet\\'s atmosphere may freeze and fall as snow to the surface.

Orbit and Rotation Eris takes 557 Earth years to make one trip around the Sun. The plane of Eris\\' orbit is well out of the plane of the solar system\\'s planets and extends far beyond the Kuiper Belt, a zone of icy debris beyond the orbit of Neptune.\\n\\nAs Eris orbits the Sun, it completes one rotation every 25.9 hours, making its day length similar to ours. Moons Eris has a very small moon called Dysnomia. Dysnomia has a nearly circular orbit lasting about 16 days. This moon is named after Eris\\' daughter, the demon goddess of lawlessness.\\n\\nDysnomia and other small moons around planets and dwarf planets allow astronomers to calculate the mass of the parent body. Dysnomia plays a role in determining how comparable Pluto and Eris are to each other. Rings Eris has no known rings. Formation Dwarf planet Eris is a member of a group of objects that orbit in a disc-like zone beyond the orbit of Neptune called the Kuiper Belt. This distant realm is populated with thousands of miniature icy worlds, which formed early in the history of our solar system about 4.5 billion years ago. These icy, rocky bodies are called Kuiper Belt objects, transneptunian objects, or plutoids. Structure We know very little about Eris\\' internal structure. Surface Eris most likely has a rocky surface similar to Pluto. Scientists think surface temperatures vary from about -359 degrees Fahrenheit (-217 degrees Celsius) to -405 degrees Fahrenheit (-243 degrees Celsius).

That means it spins nearly perfectly upright and doesn\\'t experience seasons like other more tilted planets do. Moons Ceres does not have any moons. Rings Ceres does not have any rings. Formation Ceres formed along with the rest of the solar system about 4.5 billion years ago when gravity pulled swirling gas and dust in to become a small dwarf planet. Scientists describe Ceres as an \"embryonic planet,\" which means it started to form but didn\\'t quite finish. Nearby Jupiter\\'s strong gravity prevented it from becoming a fully formed planet. About 4 billion years ago, Ceres settled into its current location among the leftover pieces of planetary formation in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. Structure Ceres is more similar to the terrestrial planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars) than its asteroid neighbors, but it is much less dense. One of the similarities is a layered interior, but Ceres\\' layers aren’t as clearly defined. Ceres probably has a solid core and a mantle made of water ice. In fact, Ceres could be composed of as much as 25 percent water. If that is correct, Ceres has more water than Earth does. Ceres\\' crust is rocky and dusty with large salt deposits. The salts on Ceres aren’t like table salt (sodium chloride), but instead are made of different minerals like magnesium sulfate. Surface Ceres is covered in countless small, young craters, but none are larger than 175 miles (280 kilometers) in diameter. This is surprising, given that the dwarf planet must have been hit by numerous large asteroids during its 4.5 billion-year lifetime.\\n\\nThe lack of craters might be due to layers of ice just below the surface.

It also mentions the possible formation of the moon system.\\n\\n Sun is unusual compared to the planets: it\\'s both elliptical and tilted. Pluto\\'s 248-year-long, oval-shaped orbit can take it as far as 49.3 astronomical units (AU) from the Sun, and as close as 30 AU. (One AU is the mean distance between Earth and the Sun: about 93 million miles or 150 million kilometers.) But on average, Pluto is 3.7 billion miles (5.9 billion kilometers) away from the Sun, or 39 AU.\\n\\nFrom 1979 to 1999, Pluto was near perihelion, when it is closest to the Sun. During this time, Pluto was actually closer to the Sun than Neptune.\\n\\nOne day on Pluto takes about 153 hours. Its axis of rotation is tilted 57 degrees with respect to the plane of its orbit around the Sun, so it spins almost on its side. Pluto also exhibits a retrograde rotation; spinning from east to west like Venus and Uranus. Moons Pluto has five known moons: Charon, Nix, Hydra, Kerberos, and Styx. This moon system might have formed by a collision between Pluto and another similar-sized body early in the history of the solar system.\\n\\nCharon, the biggest of Pluto\\'s moons, is about half the size of Pluto itself, making it the largest satellite relative to the planet it orbits in our solar system.

At that small size, Pluto is only about half the width of the United States. It\\'s about 3.6 billion miles away from the Sun, and it has a thin atmosphere composed mostly of nitrogen, methane, and carbon monoxide. On average, Pluto’s temperature is -387°F (-232°C), making it too cold to sustain life.\\n\\nPluto is orbited by five known moons, the largest of which is Charon. Charon is about half the size of Pluto itself, making it the largest satellite relative to the planet it orbits in our solar system. Pluto and Charon are often referred to as a \"double planet.\"\\n\\nThe only spacecraft to explore Pluto up close was NASA\\'s New Horizons. It flew by the dwarf planet and its moons in 2015.

He forwarded the name to the Lowell Observatory and it was selected.\\n\\nIn an interview with NASA in January 2006, Venetia said she offered the name Pluto over breakfast with her mother and grandfather. It was March 14, 1930, and her grandfather, Falconer Madan, had announced that scientists discovered the ninth planet.\\n\\n\"Venetia\\'s interest and success in naming Pluto as a schoolgirl caught the attention of the world and earned her a place in the history of planetary astronomy that lives\\n\\n### Snippet (LLM Relevance: 0.70, Related to: SURFACE PLUTO)\\n\\n*LLM Rationale for this snippet:* This chunk provides information about Pluto, including its moons, location in the Kuiper Belt, composition, and formation, which are all relevant to the query.\\n\\n, less than 100 miles (160 kilometers) wide. They\\'re also irregularly shaped, not spherical like Charon. Unlike many other moons in the solar system, these moons are not tidally locked to Pluto. They all spin and don’t keep the same face towards Pluto.\\n\\nPluto\\'s moons are named for other mythological figures associated with the underworld. Charon is named for the river Styx boatman who ferries souls in the underworld (as well as honoring Charlene, the wife of discoverer James Christy, who was nicknamed Char). The small moon Nix is named for the goddess of darkness and night, who is also the mother of Charon. Hydra is named for the nine-headed serpent that guards the underworld. Kerberos is named after the three-headed dog of Greek mythology (known as Fluffy in the Harry Potter novels). And Styx is named for the mythological river that separates the world of the living from the realm of the dead. Rings There are no known rings around Pluto. Formation Dwarf planet Pluto is a member of a group of objects that orbit in a disc-like zone beyond the orbit of Neptune called the Kuiper Belt. This distant realm is populated with thousands of miniature icy worlds, which formed early in the history of our solar system about 4.5 billion years ago. These icy, rocky bodies are called Kuiper Belt objects, transneptunian objects, or plutoids. Structure Pluto is about two-thirds the diameter of Earth\\'s Moon and probably has a rocky core surrounded by a mantle of water ice. Interesting ices like methane and nitrogen frost coat the surface. Due to its lower density, Pluto\\'s mass is about one-sixth that of Earth\\'s Moon. Surface Pluto\\'s surface has mountains, valleys, plains, and craters. The temperature on Pluto can be as cold as -375 to -400 degrees Fahrenheit (-226 to -240 degrees Celsius).\\n\\nPluto\\n\\n### Snippet (LLM Relevance: 0.70, Related to: HI\\'IAKA)\\n\\n*LLM Rationale for this snippet:* This chunk provides information about Haumea, including its size, distance from the Sun, orbital period, rotation, and moons. This information is directly relevant to the query\\'s request for a comparative overview of dwarf planets.\\n\\n teams claim credit for discovering Haumea citing evidence from observations made in 2003 and 2004 . The International Astronomical Union’s Gazetteer of Planetary Nomenclature lists the discovery location as Sierra Nevada Observatory in Spain on March 7, 2003, but no official discoverer is listed. Haumea is named after the Hawaiian goddess of fertility. Potential for Life Haumea is extremely cold and doesn\\'t appear to have conditions suitable for life. Size and Distance With an equatorial diameter of about 1,080 miles (about 1,740 kilometers), Haumea is about 1/7 the width of Earth. If Earth were the size of a nickel, Haumea would be about as big as a sesame seed. From an average distance of 4 billion miles (6.5 billion kilometers), Haumea is 43 astronomical units away from the Sun. One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth. From this distance, it takes sunlight 6 hours to travel from the Sun to Haumea. O rbit and Rotation Haumea takes 285 Earth years to make one trip around the Sun. As Haumea orbits the Sun, it completes one rotation every 4 hours, making it one of the fastest rotating large objects in our solar system.\\n\\nIt is possible that a large object impacted Haumea billions of years ago and set off Haumea\\'s spin and created its moons. Moons Haumea has two known moons: Namaka is the inner moon, and Hi\\'iaka is the outer moon. Both were discovered in 2005 and named for the mythological daughters of Haumea. Hi\\'iaka is the patron goddess of the island of Hawaii and of hula dancers. Namaka is a water spirit in Hawaiian mythology. Rings Haumea is the first known Kuiper Belt Object to have rings.

It also discusses Kuiper Belt objects and binaries, which is relevant to the context of dwarf planets.\\n\\n Neptune, Pluto makes two orbits. In this situation, Pluto never comes close enough to Neptune to be affected much by its gravity. In fact, even though its orbit crosses Neptune\\'s orbit, Pluto gets physically closer to Uranus than it ever does to Neptune. Kuiper Belt Moons and Binaries A fairly large number of KBOs either have moons – that is, significantly smaller bodies that orbit them – or are binary objects. Binaries are pairs of objects that are relatively similar in size or mass that orbit around a point – a shared center of mass – that lies between them. Some binaries actually touch, creating a sort of peanut shape, creating what\\'s known as a contact binary.\\n\\nThe small Kuiper Belt Object called Arrokoth is a contact binary. It was discovered in 2014 by NASA’s New Horizons science team, using the Hubble Space Telescope. NASA\\'s New Horizons spacecraft flew by Arrokoth on Jan. 1, 2019, snapping images that showed a double-lobed object that looked like a partially flattened red snowman. Arrokoth is the most distant and the most primitive object ever explored by a spacecraft. NASA\\'s New Horizons spacecraft flew past Arrokoth on New Year\\'s 2019, nearly four years after its historic flight through the Pluto system on July 14, 2015.\\n\\nDwarf planets Pluto, Eris, Haumea, and Makemake are all Kuiper Belt objects that have moons.\\n\\nOne thing that makes binary KBOs particularly interesting is that most of them may be extremely ancient, or primordial, objects that have been altered little since their formation. The various ideas for how these pairs form require a lot more objects than the present-day Kuiper Belt appears to contain. One leading idea is that binaries may result from low-speed collisions between KBOs, which would allow them to survive the impact and stick together due to their mutual gravity. Such collisions were likely much more\\n\\n## Connections Between Identified Themes\\n\\n- **VESTA** --[instance of]--> **ASTEROID**\\n\\n- **EUNIKE** --[instance of]--> **ASTEROID**\\n\\n- **2024 YR4** --[instance of]--> **ASTEROID**\\n\\n- **DINKINESH** --[instance of]--> **ASTEROID**\\n\\n- **PLANET** --[instance of]--> **URANUS**',\n",

It takes about 305 Earth years for this dwarf planet to make one trip around the Sun.\\nMakemake holds an important place in the history of solar system studies because it was one of the objects – along with Eris – whose discovery prompted the International Astronomical Union to reconsider the definition of a planet, and to create the new group of dwarf planets.\\nMakemake was first observed in March 2005 by M.E. Brown, C.A. Trujillo, and D.L. Rabinowitz at the Palomar Observatory, California. Its unofficial codename was Easterbunny, Brown said, \"in honor of the fact that it was discovered just a few days past Easter.\" Before this dwarf planet was confirmed, its provisional name was 2005 FY9. In 2016, NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope spotted a small, dark moon orbiting Makemake. Namesake Makemake was named after the Rapanui god of fertility.

It takes about 305 Earth years for this dwarf planet to make one trip around the Sun.\\nMakemake holds an important place in the history of solar system studies because it was one of the objects – along with Eris – whose discovery prompted the International Astronomical Union to reconsider the definition of a planet, and to create the new group of dwarf planets.\\nMakemake was first observed in March 2005 by M.E. Brown, C.A. Trujillo, and D.L. Rabinowitz at the Palomar Observatory, California. Its unofficial codename was Easterbunny, Brown said, \"in honor of the fact that it was discovered just a few days past Easter.\" Before this dwarf planet was confirmed, its provisional name was 2005 FY9. In 2016, NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope spotted a small, dark moon orbiting Makemake. Namesake Makemake was named after the Rapanui god of fertility.

Only dwarf planet Ceres is more massive in that region of rocky debris between Mars and Jupiter. NASA’s Dawn spacecraft circled Vesta from July 16, 2011, until Sept. 5, 2012, when it departed and began its journey to dwarf planet Ceres.\\nThe giant asteroid is almost spherical, and so is nearly classified a dwarf planet. Unlike most known asteroids, Vesta has separated into crust, mantle and core (a characteristic known as being differentiated), much like Earth.\\nUnderstanding why this is so was one of the objectives of the Dawn mission. The answer turned out to be that Vesta formed early, within 1 to 2 million years of the birth of the solar system.

The plane of Eris\\' orbit is well out of the plane of the solar system\\'s planets and extends far beyond the Kuiper Belt, a zone of icy debris beyond the orbit of Neptune.\\nAs Eris orbits the Sun, it completes one rotation every 25.9 hours, making its day length similar to ours. Moons Eris has a very small moon called Dysnomia. Dysnomia has a nearly circular orbit lasting about 16 days. This moon is named after Eris\\' daughter, the demon goddess of lawlessness.\\nDysnomia and other small moons around planets and dwarf planets allow astronomers to calculate the mass of the parent body. Dysnomia plays a role in determining how comparable Pluto and Eris are to each other. Rings Eris has no known rings.

That means it spins nearly perfectly upright and doesn\\'t experience seasons like other more tilted planets do. Moons Ceres does not have any moons. Rings Ceres does not have any rings. Formation Ceres formed along with the rest of the solar system about 4.5 billion years ago when gravity pulled swirling gas and dust in to become a small dwarf planet. Scientists describe Ceres as an \"embryonic planet,\" which means it started to form but didn\\'t quite finish. Nearby Jupiter\\'s strong gravity prevented it from becoming a fully formed planet. About 4 billion years ago, Ceres settled into its current location among the leftover pieces of planetary formation in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. Structure Ceres is more similar to the terrestrial planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars) than its asteroid neighbors, but it is much less dense. One of the similarities is a layered interior, but Ceres\\' layers aren’t as clearly defined. Ceres probably has a solid core and a mantle made of water ice. In fact, Ceres could be composed of as much as 25 percent water. If that is correct, Ceres has more water than Earth does. Ceres\\' crust is rocky and dusty with large salt deposits. The salts on Ceres aren’t like table salt (sodium chloride), but instead are made of different minerals like magnesium sulfate. Surface Ceres is covered in countless small, young craters, but none are larger than 175 miles (280 kilometers) in diameter. This is surprising, given that the dwarf planet must have been hit by numerous large asteroids during its 4.5 billion-year lifetime.\\nThe lack of craters might be due to layers of ice just below the surface. The surface features could smooth out over time if ice\\n### Context related to: POTENTIAL FOR LIFE (Top Chunk Score: 0.825)\\nris, the International Astronomical Union votes to change the definition of a planet. The new ruling reclassifies Pluto as a dwarf planet and reduces the number of planets in the solar system to eight. Both Eris and the asteroid Ceres are also classified as dwarf planets.\\n  * Sep 14, 2006: The International Astronomical Union (IAU) announces that the dwarf planet known as Xena will be called Eris, after the Greek goddess of discord. Eris\\'s moon is named Dysnomia, the demon goddess of lawlessness and the daughter of Eris. This is fitting since the discovery of Eris led to the demotion of Pluto from planet to dwarf planet amidst continuing debate in the science community and the public. Namesake This image of dwarf planet Eris (also known as 2003 UB313 or Xena,) was taken using the Samuel Oschin Telescope at the Palomar Observatory.\\nOriginally designated 2003 UB313 – and nicknamed for the television warrior Xena by its discovery team – Eris is named for the ancient Greek goddess of discord and strife. The name fits since Eris remains at the center of a scientific debate about the definition of a planet. Potential for Life The surface of Eris is extremely cold, so it seems unlikely that life could exist there. Size and Distance With an equatorial diameter of about 1,500 miles (2,400 kilometers), Eris is about 1/5 the width of Earth. Eris, like Pluto, is a little smaller than Earth\\'s Moon.

It was the first member of the asteroid belt to be discovered when Giuseppe Piazzi spotted it in 1801. When NASA\\'s Dawn arrived in 2015, Ceres became the first dwarf planet to receive a visit from a spacecraft.\\n\\nCalled an asteroid for many years, Ceres is so much bigger and so different from its rocky neighbors that scientists classified it as a dwarf planet in 2006. Even though Ceres comprises 25% of the asteroid belt\\'s total mass, Pluto is still 14 times more massive. Namesake Ceres is named for the Roman goddess of corn and harvests. The word cereal comes from the same name. Potential for Life Ceres is one of the few places in our solar system where scientists would like to search for possible signs of life. Ceres has something a lot of other planets don\\'t: water. Here on Earth, water is essential for life, so it\\'s possible someplace else with that ingredient and a few other conditions could support life, as well. If anything does live on Ceres, it\\'s likely to be very small microbes similar to bacteria. If Ceres does not have living things today, there may be signs it harbored life in the past. Size and Distance With a radius of 296 miles (476 kilometers), Ceres is 1/13 the radius of Earth. If Earth were the size of a nickel, Ceres would be about as big as a poppy seed.\\n\\nFrom an average distance of 257 million miles (413 million kilometers), Ceres is 2.8 astronomical units away from the Sun.

The plane of Eris\\' orbit is well out of the plane of the solar system\\'s planets and extends far beyond the Kuiper Belt, a zone of icy debris beyond the orbit of Neptune.\\n\\nAs Eris orbits the Sun, it completes one rotation every 25.9 hours, making its day length similar to ours. Moons Eris has a very small moon called Dysnomia. Dysnomia has a nearly circular orbit lasting about 16 days. This moon is named after Eris\\' daughter, the demon goddess of lawlessness.\\n\\nDysnomia and other small moons around planets and dwarf planets allow astronomers to calculate the mass of the parent body. Dysnomia plays a role in determining how comparable Pluto and Eris are to each other. Rings Eris has no known rings. Formation Dwarf planet Eris is a member of a group of objects that orbit in a disc-like zone beyond the orbit of Neptune called the Kuiper Belt. This distant realm is populated with thousands of miniature icy worlds, which formed early in the history of our solar system about 4.5 billion years ago. These icy, rocky bodies are called Kuiper Belt objects, transneptunian objects, or plutoids. Structure We know very little about Eris\\' internal structure. Surface Eris most likely has a rocky surface similar to Pluto. Scientists think surface temperatures vary from about -359 degrees Fahrenheit (-217 degrees Celsius) to -405 degrees Fahrenheit (-243 degrees Celsius).

That means it spins nearly perfectly upright and doesn\\'t experience seasons like other more tilted planets do. Moons Ceres does not have any moons. Rings Ceres does not have any rings. Formation Ceres formed along with the rest of the solar system about 4.5 billion years ago when gravity pulled swirling gas and dust in to become a small dwarf planet. Scientists describe Ceres as an \"embryonic planet,\" which means it started to form but didn\\'t quite finish. Nearby Jupiter\\'s strong gravity prevented it from becoming a fully formed planet. About 4 billion years ago, Ceres settled into its current location among the leftover pieces of planetary formation in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. Structure Ceres is more similar to the terrestrial planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars) than its asteroid neighbors, but it is much less dense. One of the similarities is a layered interior, but Ceres\\' layers aren’t as clearly defined. Ceres probably has a solid core and a mantle made of water ice. In fact, Ceres could be composed of as much as 25 percent water. If that is correct, Ceres has more water than Earth does. Ceres\\' crust is rocky and dusty with large salt deposits. The salts on Ceres aren’t like table salt (sodium chloride), but instead are made of different minerals like magnesium sulfate. Surface Ceres is covered in countless small, young craters, but none are larger than 175 miles (280 kilometers) in diameter. This is surprising, given that the dwarf planet must have been hit by numerous large asteroids during its 4.5 billion-year lifetime.\\n\\nThe lack of craters might be due to layers of ice just below the surface.

The mountains are big blocks of water ice, sometimes with a coating of frozen gases like methane.

This suggests tectonic forces are slowly resurfacing Pluto.\\n\\nThe most prominent plains observed on Pluto appear to be made of frozen nitrogen gas and show no craters. These plains do show structures suggesting convection (blobs of material circulating up and down). Atmosphere Pluto has a thin, tenuous atmosphere that expands when it comes closer to the Sun and collapses as it moves farther away – similar to a comet. The main constituent is molecular nitrogen, though molecules of methane and carbon monoxide have also been detected.\\n\\nWhen Pluto is close to the Sun, its surface ices sublimate (changing directly from solid to gas) and rise to temporarily form a thin atmosphere. Pluto\\'s low gravity (about 6% of Earth\\'s) causes the atmosphere to be much more extended in altitude than our planet\\'s atmosphere.

It also discusses Kuiper Belt objects and binaries, providing context for the location of some dwarf planets.\\n\\n Neptune, Pluto makes two orbits. In this situation, Pluto never comes close enough to Neptune to be affected much by its gravity. In fact, even though its orbit crosses Neptune\\'s orbit, Pluto gets physically closer to Uranus than it ever does to Neptune. Kuiper Belt Moons and Binaries A fairly large number of KBOs either have moons – that is, significantly smaller bodies that orbit them – or are binary objects. Binaries are pairs of objects that are relatively similar in size or mass that orbit around a point – a shared center of mass – that lies between them. Some binaries actually touch, creating a sort of peanut shape, creating what\\'s known as a contact binary.\\n\\nThe small Kuiper Belt Object called Arrokoth is a contact binary. It was discovered in 2014 by NASA’s New Horizons science team, using the Hubble Space Telescope. NASA\\'s New Horizons spacecraft flew by Arrokoth on Jan. 1, 2019, snapping images that showed a double-lobed object that looked like a partially flattened red snowman. Arrokoth is the most distant and the most primitive object ever explored by a spacecraft.

The various ideas for how these pairs form require a lot more objects than the present-day Kuiper Belt appears to contain. One leading idea is that binaries may result from low-speed collisions between KBOs, which would allow them to survive the impact and stick together due to their mutual gravity.

Pluto\\'s 248-year-long, oval-shaped orbit can take it as far as 49.3 astronomical units (AU) from the Sun, and as close as 30 AU. (One AU is the mean distance between Earth and the Sun: about 93 million miles or 150 million kilometers.) But on average, Pluto is 3.7 billion miles (5.9 billion kilometers) away from the Sun, or 39 AU.\\n\\nFrom 1979 to 1999, Pluto was near perihelion, when it is closest to the Sun. During this time, Pluto was actually closer to the Sun than Neptune.\\n\\nOne day on Pluto takes about 153 hours. Its axis of rotation is tilted 57 degrees with respect to the plane of its orbit around the Sun, so it spins almost on its side. Pluto also exhibits a retrograde rotation; spinning from east to west like Venus and Uranus. Moons Pluto has five known moons: Charon, Nix, Hydra, Kerberos, and Styx. This moon system might have formed by a collision between Pluto and another similar-sized body early in the history of the solar system.\\n\\nCharon, the biggest of Pluto\\'s moons, is about half the size of Pluto itself, making it the largest satellite relative to the planet it orbits in our solar system.

Orbit and Rotation Eris takes 557 Earth years to make one trip around the Sun. The plane of Eris\\' orbit is well out of the plane of the solar system\\'s planets and extends far beyond the Kuiper Belt, a zone of icy debris beyond the orbit of Neptune.\\nAs Eris orbits the Sun, it completes one rotation every 25.9 hours, making its day length similar to ours. Moons Eris has a very small moon called Dysnomia. Dysnomia has a nearly circular orbit lasting about 16 days. This moon is named after Eris\\' daughter, the demon goddess of lawlessness.\\nDysnomia and other small moons around planets and dwarf planets allow astronomers to calculate the mass of the parent body. Dysnomia plays a role in determining how comparable Pluto and Eris are to each other. Rings Eris has no known rings. Formation Dwarf planet Eris is a member of a group of objects that orbit in a disc-like zone beyond the orbit of Neptune called the Kuiper Belt. This distant realm is populated with thousands of miniature icy worlds, which formed early in the history of our solar system about 4.5 billion years ago. These icy, rocky bodies are called Kuiper Belt objects, transneptunian objects, or plutoids. Structure We know very little about Eris\\' internal structure. Surface Eris most likely has a rocky surface similar to Pluto. Scientists think surface temperatures vary from about -359 degrees Fahrenheit (-217 degrees Celsius) to -405 degrees Fahrenheit (-243 degrees Celsius). Atmosphere The dwarf planet is often so far from the Sun that its atmosphere collapses and freezes, falling to the surface as snow. As it gets closest to the Sun in its faraway orbit, the atmosphere thaws. Magnetosphere Nothing is known about Eris\\' magnetosphere.\\none of nine? more or less? What is a Planet?

Surface We can\\'t see too many details of Makemake\\'s surface from so far away, but it does appear to be a reddish-brownish color, similar to Pluto. Scientists have also detected frozen methane and ethane on its surface. In fact, pellets of frozen methane as big as half an inch (1 centimeter) in diameter may rest on Makemake\\'s cold surface. Atmosphere Makemake may develop a very thin atmosphere, most likely made of nitrogen, near perihelion – when it is closest to the Sun. Magnetosphere Scientists do not know if Makemake has a magnetosphere.\\nKeep Exploring Discover More Topics From NASA Sun Planets Asteroids, Comets & Meteors Kuiper Belt National Aeronautics and Space Administration NASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery.\\n  * About NASA\\'s Mission Join Us * Home * News & Events * Multimedia * NASA+ * Missions * Humans in Space * Earth * The Solar System * The Universe * Science * Aeronautics * Technology * Learning Resources * About NASA * NASA en Español Follow NASA More NASA Social Accounts NASA Newsletters Sitemap For Media Privacy Policy FOIA No FEAR Act Office of the IG Budget & Annual Reports Agency Financial Reports Contact NASA Accessibility Page Last Updated: \\nApr 24, 2025 Page Editor: \\nAMANDA BARNETT Responsible NASA Official for Science: \\nDana Bolles\\n* Explore Search * News & Events ### News & Events * Recently Published * Video Series on NASA+ * Podcasts * Blogs * Newsletters * Social Media * Media Resources * Multimedia ### Multimedia * Images * Videos on NASA\\n Missions A to Z List of Missions Upcoming Launches and Landings Spaceships and Rockets Communicating with Missions Artemis James Webb Space Telescope Hubble Space Telescope International Space Station OSIRIS-REx Humans in Space Why Go to Space Astronauts Commercial Space Destinations Spaceships and Rockets Living in Space Earth Explore Earth Science Climate Change Earth, Our Planet Earth Science in Action Earth Multimedia Earth Data Earth Science Researchers The Solar System The Sun Mercury Venus Earth The Moon Mars Jupiter Saturn Uranus Neptune Pluto & Dwarf Planets Asteroids, Comets & Meteors The Kuiper Belt The Oort Cloud Skywatching The Universe Exoplanets The Search for Life in the Universe Stars Galaxies Black Holes The Big Bang Dark Matter Dark Energy Science Earth Science Planetary Science Astrophysics & Space Science The Sun & Heliophysics Biological & Physical Sciences Lunar Science Citizen Science Astromaterials Aeronautics Research Human Space Travel Research Aeronautics Science in the Air NASA Aircraft Flight Innovation Supersonic Flight Air Traffic Solutions Green Aviation Tech Drones & You Technology Technology Transfer & Spinoffs Space Travel Technology Technology Living in Space Manufacturing and Materials Robotics Science Instruments Computing Learning Resources For Kids and Students For Educators For Colleges and Universities For Professionals Science for Everyone Requests for Exhibits, Artifacts, or Speakers STEM Engagement at NASA About NASA NASA\\'s Impacts Centers and Facilities Directorates Organizations People of NASA Careers Internships Our History Doing Business with NASA Get Involved Contact NASA en Español Ciencia Aeronáutica Ciencias Terrestres Sistema Solar Universo News & Events Recently Published Video Series on NASA+ Podcasts Blogs Newsletters Social Media Media Resources Multimedia Images Videos on NASA+ Sounds and Ringtones Interactives NASA Apps Podcasts e-Books STEM Multimedia Highlights 2 min read Hubble Images a Peculiar Spiral article 3 days ago 6 min read NASA’s SPHEREx Space Telescope Begins\\n### Context related to: JAMES WEBB SPACE TELESCOPE (Top Chunk Score: 0.832)\\n: NASA Brings Exploration to FIRST Robotics 2025  article 5 days ago 5 min read NASA’s Lunar Drill Technology Passes Tests on the Moon article 5 days ago 2 min read NASA Technology Enables Leaps in Artificial Intelligence article 5 days ago Highlights 9 min read ARMD Research Solicitations (Updated May 1) article 3 days ago 3 min read NASA Invests in Future STEM Workforce Through Space Grant Awards  article 3 days ago 7 min read ¿Qué es una caminata espacial?

Asteroids Home Facts Exploration Featured Asteroids 2024 YR4 Apophis Psyche Bennu Dinkinesh and Selam Donaldjohanson Didymos and Dimorphos Vesta Eros Ida and Dactyl Itokawa Resources Solar System Home Vesta Overview Vesta is the second most massive body in the main asteroid belt, accounting for almost 9% of the total mass of all asteroids. Only dwarf planet Ceres is more massive in that region of rocky debris between Mars and Jupiter. NASA’s Dawn spacecraft circled Vesta from July 16, 2011, until Sept. 5, 2012, when it departed and began its journey to dwarf planet Ceres.\\nThe giant asteroid is almost spherical, and so is nearly classified a dwarf planet. Unlike most known asteroids, Vesta has separated into crust, mantle and core (a characteristic known as being differentiated), much like Earth.\\nUnderstanding why this is so was one of the objectives of the Dawn mission. The answer turned out to be that Vesta formed early, within 1 to 2 million years of the birth of the solar system. Short-lived radioactive material that was incorporated into bodies that formed during this epoch heated them to the point where—in cases like Vesta—the objects melted, allowing the dens\\n### Context related to: PLUTO & DWARF PLANETS (Top Chunk Score: 0.827)\\n Change Earth, Our Planet Earth Science in Action Earth Multimedia Earth Data Earth Science Researchers The Solar System The Sun Mercury Venus Earth The Moon Mars Jupiter Saturn Uranus Neptune Pluto & Dwarf Planets Asteroids, Comets & Meteors The Kuiper Belt The Oort Cloud Skywatching The Universe Exoplanets The Search for Life in the Universe Stars Galaxies Black Holes The Big Bang Dark Matter Dark Energy Science Earth Science Planetary Science Astrophysics & Space Science The Sun & Heliophysics Biological & Physical Sciences Lunar Science Citizen Science Astromaterials Aeronautics Research Human Space Travel Research Aeronautics Science in the Air NASA Aircraft Flight Innovation Supersonic Flight Air Traffic Solutions Green Aviation Tech Drones & You Technology Technology Transfer & Spinoffs Space Travel Technology Technology Living in Space Manufacturing and Materials Robotics Science Instruments Computing Learning Resources For Kids and Students For Educators For Colleges and Universities For Professionals Science for Everyone Requests for Exhibits, Artifacts, or Speakers STEM Engagement at NASA About NASA NASA\\'s Impacts Centers and Facilities Directorates Organizations People of NASA Careers Internships Our History Doing Business with NASA Get Involved Contact NASA en Español Ciencia Aeronáutica Ciencias Terrestres Sistema Solar Universo News & Events Recently Published Video Series on NASA+ Podcasts Blogs Newsletters Social Media Media Resources Multimedia Images Videos on NASA+ Sounds and Ringtones Interactives NASA Apps Podcasts e-Books STEM Multimedia Highlights 2 min read Hubble Images a Peculiar Spiral article 3 days ago 6 min read NASA’s SPHEREx Space Telescope Begins Capturing Entire Sky article 3 days ago 4 min read NASA’s Chandra Diagnoses Cause of Fracture in Galactic “Bone” article 3 days ago Highlights 1 min read HALO Arrives in the US article 4 days ago 3 min read Lunar Space Station Module for NASA’s Artemis Campaign to\\n NASAarticle3 days ago Back Missions Search All NASA Missions A to Z List of Missions Upcoming Launches and Landings Spaceships and Rockets Communicating with Missions Artemis James Webb Space Telescope Hubble Space Telescope International Space Station OSIRIS-REx Humans in Space Why Go to Space Astronauts Commercial Space Destinations Spaceships and Rockets Living in Space Earth Explore Earth Science Climate Change Earth, Our Planet Earth Science in Action Earth Multimedia Earth Data Earth Science Researchers The Solar System The Sun Mercury Venus Earth The Moon Mars Jupiter Saturn Uranus Neptune Pluto & Dwarf Planets Asteroids, Comets & Meteors The Kuiper Belt The Oort Cloud Skywatching The Universe Exoplanets The Search for Life in the Universe Stars Galaxies Black Holes The Big Bang Dark Matter Dark Energy Science Earth Science Planetary Science Astrophysics & Space Science The Sun & Heliophysics Biological & Physical Sciences Lunar Science Citizen Science Astromaterials Aeronautics Research Human Space Travel Research Aeronautics Science in the Air NASA Aircraft Flight Innovation Supersonic Flight Air Traffic Solutions Green Aviation Tech Drones & You Technology Technology Transfer & Spinoffs Space Travel Technology Technology Living in Space Manufacturing and Materials Robotics Science Instruments Computing Learning Resources For Kids and Students For Educators For Colleges and Universities For Professionals Science for Everyone Requests for Exhibits, Artifacts, or Speakers STEM Engagement at NASA About NASA NASA\\'s Impacts Centers and Facilities Directorates Organizations People of NASA Careers Internships Our History Doing Business with NASA Get Involved Contact NASA en Español Ciencia Aeronáutica Ciencias Terrestres Sistema Solar Universo News & Events Recently Published Video Series on NASA+ Podcasts Blogs Newsletters Social Media Media Resources Multimedia Images Videos on NASA+ Sounds and Ringtones Interactives NASA Apps Podcasts e-Books STEM Multimedia Highlights 2 min read Hubble Images a Peculiar Spiral article 2 days ago 6 min read',\n",

This temperature range could accommodate Earthly life, such as “extremophile” microbes. And atmospheric pressure at that height is similar to what we find on Earth’s surface.\\nAt the tops of Venus’ clouds, whipped around the planet by winds measured as high as 224 mph (360 kph), we find another transformation. Persistent, dark streaks appear. Scientists are so far unable to explain why these streaks remain stubbornly intact, even amid hurricane-force winds. They also have the odd habit of absorbing ultraviolet radiation.\\nThe most likely explanations focus on fine particles, ice crystals, or even a chemical compound called iron chloride. Although it\\'s much less likely, another possibility considered by scientists who study astrobiology is that these streaks could be made up of microbial life, Venus-style. Astrobiologists note that ring-shaped linkages of sulfur atoms, known to exist in Venus’ atmosphere, could provide microbes with a kind of coating that would protect them from sulfuric acid. These handy chemical cloaks would also absorb potentially damaging ultraviolet light and re-radiate it as visible light.\\nSome of the Russian Venera probes did, indeed, detect particles in Venus’ lower atmosphere about a micron in length – roughly the same size as a bacterium on Earth.\\nNone of these findings provide compelling evidence for the existence of life in Venus’ clouds. But the questions they raise, along with Venus’ vanished ocean, its violently volcanic surface, and its hellish history, make a compelling case for missions to investigate our temperamental sister planet. There is much, it would seem, that she can teach us. Size and Distance Venus orbits the Sun from an average distance of 67 million miles (108 million kilometers), or 0.72 astronomical units. One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth. From this distance, it takes sunlight about six minutes\\n\\ntitle: Venus: Landscape, Atmosphere, and Magnetosphere\\n text: est impact craters of any rocky planet.\\nOther notable features of the Venus landscape include:\\n  * A volcanic crater named Sacajawea for Lewis and Clark’s Native American guide.\\n  * A deep canyon called Diana for the Roman goddess of the hunt.\\n  * “Pancake” domes with flat tops and steep sides, as wide as 38 miles (62 kilometers), likely formed by the extrusion of highly viscous lava.\\n  * “Tick” domes, odd volcanoes with radiating spurs that, from above, make them look like their blood-feeding namesake.\\n  * Tesserae, terrain with intricate patterns of ridges and grooves that suggest the scorching temperatures make rock behave in some ways more like peanut butter beneath a thin and strong chocolate layer on Venus. Atmosphere Venus’ atmosphere is one of extremes. With the hottest surface in the solar system, apart from the Sun itself, Venus is hotter even than the innermost planet, charbroiled Mercury. The atmosphere is mostly carbon dioxide – the same gas driving the greenhouse effect on Venus and Earth – with clouds composed of sulfuric acid. And at the surface, the hot, high-pressure carbon dioxide behaves in a corrosive fashion. But higher up in the atmosphere, temperatures and pressure begin to ease. Magnetosphere Even though Venus is similar in size to Earth and has a similar-sized iron core, the planet does not have its own internally generated magnetic field. Instead, Venus has what is known as an induced magnetic field. This weak magnetic field is created by the interaction of the Sun\\'s magnetic field and the planet\\'s outer atmosphere. Ultraviolet light from the Sun excites gases in Venus\\' outermost atmosphere; these electrically excited gases are called ions, and thus this region is called the ionosphere (Earth has an ionosphere as well).

Potential for Life Scientists don\\'t expect to find living things currently thriving on Mars. Instead, they\\'re looking for signs of life that existed long ago, when Mars was warmer and covered with water. Size and Distance With a radius of 2,106 miles (3,390 kilometers), Mars is about half the size of Earth. If Earth were the size of a nickel, Mars would be about as big as a raspberry.\\nFrom an average distance of 142 million miles (228 million kilometers), Mars is 1.5 astronomical units away from the Sun. One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth. From this distance, it takes sunlight 13 minutes to travel from the Sun to Mars. Orbit and Rotation As Mars orbits the Sun, it completes one rotation every 24.6 hours, which is very similar to one day on Earth (23.9 hours). Martian days are called sols – short for \"solar day.\" A year on Mars lasts 669.6 sols, which is the same as 687 Earth days.\\nMars\\' axis of rotation is tilted 25 degrees with respect to the plane of its orbit around the Sun. This is another similarity with Earth, which has an axial tilt of 23.4 degrees. Like Earth, Mars has distinct seasons, but they last longer than seasons here on Earth since Mars takes longer to orbit the Sun (because it\\'s farther away). And while here on Earth the seasons are evenly spread over the year, lasting 3 months (or one quarter of a year), on Mars the seasons vary in length because of Mars\\' elliptical, egg-shaped orbit around the Sun.\\nSpring in the northern hemisphere (autumn in the southern) is the longest season at 194 sols.\\n\\ntitle: Overview of Our Solar System\\n text: , and New Horizons – will eventually hit interstellar space. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Contents Introduction Namesake Potential for Life Size and Distance Moons Formation Structure Introduction Our solar system includes the Sun, eight planets, five officially named dwarf planets , hundreds of moons, and thousands of asteroids and comets.

Our Sun is in a small, partial arm of the Milky Way called the Orion Arm, or Orion Spur, between the Sagittarius and Perseus arms. Our solar system orbits the center of the galaxy at about 515,000 mph (828,000 kph). It takes about 230 million years to complete one orbit around the galactic center.\\nUnable to render the provided source Namesake Our planetary system is called “the solar system” because we use the word “solar” to describe things related to our star, after the Latin word for Sun, \"solis.\" Potential for Life So far, we\\'ve only know about life on Earth, but NASA is searching for life on other worlds in our solar system and beyond. Size and Distance Our solar system extends much farther than the planets that orbit the Sun. The solar system also includes the Kuiper Belt that lies past Neptune\\'s orbit. This is a ring of icy bodies, almost all smaller than the most popular Kuiper Belt Object – dwarf planet Pluto .\\nBeyond the fringes of the Kuiper Belt is the Oort Cloud . This giant spherical shell surrounds our solar system. It has never been directly observed, but its existence is predicted based on mathematical models and observations of comets that likely originate there.\\nThe Oort Cloud is made of icy pieces of space debris - some bigger than mountains – orbiting our Sun as far as 1.6 light-years away.

Atmosphere Venus’ atmosphere is one of extremes. With the hottest surface in the solar system, apart from the Sun itself, Venus is hotter even than the innermost planet, charbroiled Mercury. The atmosphere is mostly carbon dioxide – the same gas driving the greenhouse effect on Venus and Earth – with clouds composed of sulfuric acid. And at the surface, the hot, high-pressure carbon dioxide behaves in a corrosive fashion. But higher up in the atmosphere, temperatures and pressure begin to ease. Magnetosphere Even though Venus is similar in size to Earth and has a similar-sized iron core, the planet does not have its own internally generated magnetic field. Instead, Venus has what is known as an induced magnetic field. This weak magnetic field is created by the interaction of the Sun\\'s magnetic field and the planet\\'s outer atmosphere. Ultraviolet light from the Sun excites gases in Venus\\' outermost atmosphere; these electrically excited gases are called ions, and thus this region is called the ionosphere (Earth has an ionosphere as well).

Size and Distance With a radius of 2,106 miles (3,390 kilometers), Mars is about half the size of Earth. If Earth were the size of a nickel, Mars would be about as big as a raspberry.\\n\\nFrom an average distance of 142 million miles (228 million kilometers), Mars is 1.5 astronomical units away from the Sun. One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth. From this distance, it takes sunlight 13 minutes to travel from the Sun to Mars. Orbit and Rotation As Mars orbits the Sun, it completes one rotation every 24.6 hours, which is very similar to one day on Earth (23.9 hours). Martian days are called sols – short for \"solar day.\" A year on Mars lasts 669.6 sols, which is the same as 687 Earth days.\\n\\nMars\\' axis of rotation is tilted 25 degrees with respect to the plane of its orbit around the Sun. This is another similarity with Earth, which has an axial tilt of 23.4 degrees.

And while here on Earth the seasons are evenly spread over the year, lasting 3 months (or one quarter of a year), on Mars the seasons vary in length because of Mars\\' elliptical, egg-shaped orbit around the Sun.\\n\\nSpring in the northern hemisphere (autumn in the southern) is the longest season at 194 sols.\\n\\n### Snippet (LLM Relevance: 0.30, Related to: MARS)\\n\\n*LLM Rationale for this snippet:* This chunk mentions Mars and its exploration, including past conditions and evidence of water, but it doesn\\'t provide a direct comparison to Venus or a detailed discussion of current scientific thinking about life, making it somewhat relevant.\\n\\nticas article 2 months ago 1 min read Mejores imágenes de Ciencia en la estación espacial 2024 article 3 months ago 11 min read La NASA identifica causa de pérdida de material del escudo térmico de Orion de Artemis I article 5 months ago Explore Mars In Depth\\n\\n  1. … 2.

Venus is the third brightest object in the sky after the Sun and Moon. Venus spins slowly in the opposite direction from most planets. \\n\\nVenus is similar in structure and size to Earth, and is sometimes called Earth\\'s evil twin. Its thick atmosphere traps heat in a runaway greenhouse effect, making it the hottest planet in our solar system with surface temperatures hot enough to melt lead. Below the dense, persistent clouds, the surface has volcanoes and deformed mountains.

They named the objects after their most important gods. \\n\\nVenus is named for the ancient Roman goddess of love and beauty, who was known as Aphrodite to the ancient Greeks. Most features on Venus are named for women. It’s the only planet named after a female god.

Today a key element of this process could be operating: subduction, or the sliding of one continental “plate” beneath another, which can also trigger volcanoes. Subduction is believed to be the first step in creating plate tectonics.\\n\\nNASA’s Magellan spacecraft, which ended a five-year mission to Venus in 1994, mapped the broiling surface using radar. Magellan saw a land of extreme volcanism – a relatively young surface, one recently reshaped (in geologic terms), and chains of towering mountains. Surface The Soviet Union sent a series of probes to Venus between 1961 and 1984 as part of its Venera program (Venera is Russian for Venus). Ten probes made it to the surface, and a few functioned briefly after landing. The longest survivor lasted two hours; the shortest, 23 minutes. Photos snapped before the landers fried show a barren, dim, and rocky landscape, and a sky that is likely some shade of sulfur yellow.\\n\\nVolcanoes and tectonic forces appear to have erased most traces of the early surface of Venus. Newer computer models indicate the resurfacing may have happened piecemeal over an extended period of time. The average age of surface features could be as young as 150 million years, with some older surfaces mixed in.\\n\\nVenus has valleys and high mountains dotted with thousands of volcanoes. Its surface features – most named for both real and mythical women – include Ishtar Terra, a rocky, highland area around the size of Australia near the north pole, and an even larger, South-America-sized region called Aphrodite Terra that stretches across the equator. One mountain reaches 36,000 feet (11 kilometers), higher than Mt. Everest.

Nasser suggested that Skiff request that the IAU officially name the asteroid Zoozve. Skiff agreed, and the name Zoozve was approved in February 2024. Rings Venus has no rings. Formation A critical question for scientists who search for life among the stars: How do habitable planets get their start? The close similarities of early Venus and Earth, and their very different fates, provide a kind of test case for scientists who study planet formation. Similar size, similar interior structure, both harboring oceans in their younger days. Yet one is now an inferno, while the other is the only known world to host abundant life. The factors that set these planets on almost opposite paths began, most likely, in the swirling disk of gas and dust from which they were born. Somehow, 4.6 billion years ago that disk around our Sun accreted, cooled, and settled into the planets we know today. Better knowledge of the formation history of Venus could help us better understand Earth – and rocky planets around other stars. Structure If we could slice Venus and Earth in half, pole to pole, and place them side by side, they would look remarkably similar. Each planet has an iron core enveloped by a hot-rock mantle; the thinnest of skins forms a rocky, exterior crust. On both planets, this thin skin changes form and sometimes erupts into volcanoes in response to the ebb and flow of heat and pressure deep beneath.\\n\\nOn Earth, the slow movement of continents over thousands and millions of years reshapes the surface, a process known as “\\n\\n## Connections Between Identified Themes\\n\\n- **VESTA** --[instance of]--> **ASTEROID**\\n\\n- **EUNIKE** --[instance of]--> **ASTEROID**\\n\\n- **2024 YR4** --[instance of]--> **ASTEROID**\\n\\n- **DINKINESH** --[instance of]--> **ASTEROID**\\n\\n- **PLANET** --[instance of]--> **URANUS**',\n",

Persistent, dark streaks appear. Scientists are so far unable to explain why these streaks remain stubbornly intact, even amid hurricane-force winds. They also have the odd habit of absorbing ultraviolet radiation.\\nThe most likely explanations focus on fine particles, ice crystals, or even a chemical compound called iron chloride. Although it\\'s much less likely, another possibility considered by scientists who study astrobiology is that these streaks could be made up of microbial life, Venus-style. Astrobiologists note that ring-shaped linkages of sulfur atoms, known to exist in Venus’ atmosphere, could provide microbes with a kind of coating that would protect them from sulfuric acid. These handy chemical cloaks would also absorb potentially damaging ultraviolet light and re-radiate it as visible light.\\nSome of the Russian Venera probes did, indeed, detect particles in Venus’ lower atmosphere about a micron in length – roughly the same size as a bacterium on Earth.\\nNone of these findings provide compelling evidence for the existence of life in Venus’ clouds.

Persistent, dark streaks appear. Scientists are so far unable to explain why these streaks remain stubbornly intact, even amid hurricane-force winds. They also have the odd habit of absorbing ultraviolet radiation.\\nThe most likely explanations focus on fine particles, ice crystals, or even a chemical compound called iron chloride. Although it\\'s much less likely, another possibility considered by scientists who study astrobiology is that these streaks could be made up of microbial life, Venus-style. Astrobiologists note that ring-shaped linkages of sulfur atoms, known to exist in Venus’ atmosphere, could provide microbes with a kind of coating that would protect them from sulfuric acid. These handy chemical cloaks would also absorb potentially damaging ultraviolet light and re-radiate it as visible light.\\nSome of the Russian Venera probes did, indeed, detect particles in Venus’ lower atmosphere about a micron in length – roughly the same size as a bacterium on Earth.\\nNone of these findings provide compelling evidence for the existence of life in Venus’ clouds.

From this distance, it takes sunlight about six minutes\\n### Context related to: TESSERAE (Top Chunk Score: 0.838)\\nest impact craters of any rocky planet.\\nOther notable features of the Venus landscape include:\\n  * A volcanic crater named Sacajawea for Lewis and Clark’s Native American guide.\\n  * A deep canyon called Diana for the Roman goddess of the hunt.\\n  * “Pancake” domes with flat tops and steep sides, as wide as 38 miles (62 kilometers), likely formed by the extrusion of highly viscous lava.\\n  * “Tick” domes, odd volcanoes with radiating spurs that, from above, make them look like their blood-feeding namesake.\\n  * Tesserae, terrain with intricate patterns of ridges and grooves that suggest the scorching temperatures make rock behave in some ways more like peanut butter beneath a thin and strong chocolate layer on Venus. Atmosphere Venus’ atmosphere is one of extremes. With the hottest surface in the solar system, apart from the Sun itself, Venus is hotter even than the innermost planet, charbroiled Mercury. The atmosphere is mostly carbon dioxide – the same gas driving the greenhouse effect on Venus and Earth – with clouds composed of sulfuric acid. And at the surface, the hot, high-pressure carbon dioxide behaves in a corrosive fashion. But higher up in the atmosphere, temperatures and pressure begin to ease. Magnetosphere Even though Venus is similar in size to Earth and has a similar-sized iron core, the planet does not have its own internally generated magnetic field. Instead, Venus has what is known as an induced magnetic field. This weak magnetic field is created by the interaction of the Sun\\'s magnetic field and the planet\\'s outer atmosphere. Ultraviolet light from the Sun excites gases in Venus\\' outermost atmosphere; these electrically excited gases are called ions, and thus this region is called the ionosphere (Earth has an ionosphere as well).

Introduction Namesake Potential for Life Size and Distance Orbit and Rotation Moons Rings Formation Structure Surface Atmosphere Magnetosphere Introduction As it sped away from Venus in February 1974, NASA’s Mariner 10 spacecraft captured this seemingly peaceful view of Venus. But, contrary to its serene appearance, Venus is a world of intense heat, crushing atmospheric pressure and clouds of corrosive acid.\\nNASA/JPL-Caltech\\nVenus is the second planet from the Sun, and Earth\\'s closest planetary neighbor. Venus is the third brightest object in the sky after the Sun and Moon. Venus spins slowly in the opposite direction from most planets. \\nVenus is similar in structure and size to Earth, and is sometimes called Earth\\'s evil twin. Its thick atmosphere traps heat in a runaway greenhouse effect, making it the hottest planet in our solar system with surface temperatures hot enough to melt lead. Below the dense, persistent clouds, the surface has volcanoes and deformed mountains. Namesake The ancient Romans could easily see seven bright objects in the sky: the Sun, the Moon, and the five brightest planets: Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. They named the objects after their most important gods. \\nVenus is named for the ancient Roman goddess of love and beauty, who was known as Aphrodite to the ancient Greeks. Most features on Venus are named for women. It’s the only planet named after a female god.

Nasser suggested that Skiff request that the IAU officially name the asteroid Zoozve. Skiff agreed, and the name Zoozve was approved in February 2024. Rings Venus has no rings. Formation A critical question for scientists who search for life among the stars: How do habitable planets get their start? The close similarities of early Venus and Earth, and their very different fates, provide a kind of test case for scientists who study planet formation. Similar size, similar interior structure, both harboring oceans in their younger days. Yet one is now an inferno, while the other is the only known world to host abundant life. The factors that set these planets on almost opposite paths began, most likely, in the swirling disk of gas and dust from which they were born. Somehow, 4.6 billion years ago that disk around our Sun accreted, cooled, and settled into the planets we know today. Better knowledge of the formation history of Venus could help us better understand Earth – and rocky planets around other stars. Structure If we could slice Venus and Earth in half, pole to pole, and place them side by side, they would look remarkably similar. Each planet has an iron core enveloped by a hot-rock mantle; the thinnest of skins forms a rocky, exterior crust. On both planets, this thin skin changes form and sometimes erupts into volcanoes in response to the ebb and flow of heat and pressure deep beneath.\\nOn Earth, the slow movement of continents over thousands and millions of years reshapes the surface, a process known as “\\nher,\" meaning \"the red one.\" Even today, it is frequently called the \"Red Planet\" because iron minerals in the Martian dirt oxidize, or rust, causing the surface to look red. Potential for Life Scientists don\\'t expect to find living things currently thriving on Mars. Instead, they\\'re looking for signs of life that existed long ago, when Mars was warmer and covered with water. Size and Distance With a radius of 2,106 miles (3,390 kilometers), Mars is about half the size of Earth. If Earth were the size of a nickel, Mars would be about as big as a raspberry.\\nFrom an average distance of 142 million miles (228 million kilometers), Mars is 1.5 astronomical units away from the Sun. One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth. From this distance, it takes sunlight 13 minutes to travel from the Sun to Mars. Orbit and Rotation As Mars orbits the Sun, it completes one rotation every 24.6 hours, which is very similar to one day on Earth (23.9 hours). Martian days are called sols – short for \"solar day.\" A year on Mars lasts 669.6 sols, which is the same as 687 Earth days.\\nMars\\' axis of rotation is tilted 25 degrees with respect to the plane of its orbit around the Sun. This is another similarity with Earth, which has an axial tilt of 23.4 degrees. Like Earth, Mars has distinct seasons, but they last longer than seasons here on Earth since Mars takes longer to orbit the Sun (because it\\'s farther away). And while here on Earth the seasons are evenly spread over the year, lasting 3 months (or one quarter of a year), on Mars the seasons vary in length because of Mars\\' elliptical, egg-shaped orbit around the Sun.\\nSpring in the northern hemisphere (autumn in the southern) is the longest season at 194 sols.\\n### Context related to: JUPITER (Top Chunk Score: 0.819)\\nBooks * STEM Multimedia * NASA+ Search Suggested Searches Climate Change Artemis Expedition 64 Mars perseverance SpaceX Crew-2 International Space Station View All Topics A-Z Home Missions Humans in Space Earth The Solar System The Universe Science Aeronautics Technology Learning Resources About NASA Español News & Events Multimedia NASA+ Highlights 2 min readHubble Images a Peculiar Spiralarticle2 days ago 6 min readNASA’s Juno Mission Gets Under Jupiter’s and Io’s Surfacearticle5 days ago 6 min readWhat’s Up: May 2025 Skywatching Tips from NASAarticle3 days ago Back Missions Search All NASA Missions A to Z List of Missions Upcoming Launches and Landings Spaceships and Rockets Communicating with Missions Artemis James Webb Space Telescope Hubble Space Telescope International Space Station OSIRIS-REx Humans in Space Why Go to Space Astronauts Commercial Space Destinations Spaceships and Rockets Living in Space Earth Explore Earth Science Climate Change Earth, Our Planet Earth Science in Action Earth Multimedia Earth Data Earth Science Researchers The Solar System The Sun Mercury Venus Earth The Moon Mars Jupiter Saturn Uranus Neptune Pluto & Dwarf Planets Asteroids, Comets & Meteors The Kuiper Belt The Oort Cloud Skywatching The Universe Exoplanets The Search for Life in the Universe Stars Galaxies Black Holes The Big Bang Dark Matter Dark Energy Science Earth Science Planetary Science Astrophysics & Space Science The Sun & Heliophysics Biological & Physical Sciences Lunar Science Citizen Science Astromaterials Aeronautics Research Human Space Travel Research Aeronautics Science in the Air NASA Aircraft Flight Innovation Supersonic Flight Air Traffic Solutions Green Aviation Tech Drones & You Technology Technology Transfer & Spinoffs Space Travel Technology Technology Living in Space Manufacturing and Materials Robotics Science Instruments Computing Learning Resources For Kids and Students For Educators For Colleges and Universities For Professionals Science for Everyone Requests for Exhibits, Artifacts, or Speakers STEM Engagement\\n### Context related to: URANUS (Top Chunk Score: 0.819)\\n * STEM Multimedia * NASA+ Search Suggested Searches Climate Change Artemis Expedition 64 Mars perseverance SpaceX Crew-2 International Space Station View All Topics A-Z Home Missions Humans in Space Earth The Solar System The Universe Science Aeronautics Technology Learning Resources About NASA Español News & Events Multimedia NASA+ Highlights 2 min readHubble Images a Peculiar Spiralarticle3 days ago 6 min readNASA’s Juno Mission Gets Under Jupiter’s and Io’s Surfacearticle5 days ago 6 min readWhat’s Up: May 2025 Skywatching Tips from NASAarticle3 days ago Back Missions Search All NASA Missions A to Z List of Missions Upcoming Launches and Landings Spaceships and Rockets Communicating with Missions Artemis James Webb Space Telescope Hubble Space Telescope International Space Station OSIRIS-REx Humans in Space Why Go to Space Astronauts Commercial Space Destinations Spaceships and Rockets Living in Space Earth Explore Earth Science Climate Change Earth, Our Planet Earth Science in Action Earth Multimedia Earth Data Earth Science Researchers The Solar System The Sun Mercury Venus Earth The Moon Mars Jupiter Saturn Uranus Neptune Pluto & Dwarf Planets Asteroids, Comets & Meteors The Kuiper Belt The Oort Cloud Skywatching The Universe Exoplanets The Search for Life in the Universe Stars Galaxies Black Holes The Big Bang Dark Matter Dark Energy Science Earth Science Planetary Science Astrophysics & Space Science The Sun & Heliophysics Biological & Physical Sciences Lunar Science Citizen Science Astromaterials Aeronautics Research Human Space Travel Research Aeronautics Science in the Air NASA Aircraft Flight Innovation Supersonic Flight Air Traffic Solutions Green Aviation Tech Drones & You Technology Technology Transfer & Spinoffs Space Travel Technology Technology Living in Space Manufacturing and Materials Robotics Science Instruments Computing Learning Resources For Kids and Students For Educators For Colleges and Universities For Professionals Science for Everyone Requests for Exhibits, Artifacts, or Speakers STEM Engagement at\\n### Context related to: NASA (Top Chunk Score: 0.818)\\n, a process known as “plate tectonics.” Something similar might have happened on Venus early in its history. Today a key element of this process could be operating: subduction, or the sliding of one continental “plate” beneath another, which can also trigger volcanoes. Subduction is believed to be the first step in creating plate tectonics.\\nNASA’s Magellan spacecraft, which ended a five-year mission to Venus in 1994, mapped the broiling surface using radar. Magellan saw a land of extreme volcanism – a relatively young surface, one recently reshaped (in geologic terms), and chains of towering mountains. Surface The Soviet Union sent a series of probes to Venus between 1961 and 1984 as part of its Venera program (Venera is Russian for Venus). Ten probes made it to the surface, and a few functioned briefly after landing. The longest survivor lasted two hours; the shortest, 23 minutes. Photos snapped before the landers fried show a barren, dim, and rocky landscape, and a sky that is likely some shade of sulfur yellow.\\nVolcanoes and tectonic forces appear to have erased most traces of the early surface of Venus. Newer computer models indicate the resurfacing may have happened piecemeal over an extended period of time. The average age of surface features could be as young as 150 million years, with some older surfaces mixed in.\\nVenus has valleys and high mountains dotted with thousands of volcanoes. Its surface features – most named for both real and mythical women – include Ishtar Terra, a rocky, highland area around the size of Australia near the north pole, and an even larger, South-America-sized region called Aphrodite Terra that stretches across the equator. One mountain reaches 36,000 feet (11 kilometers), higher than Mt. Everest.

Today, water on Mars is found in the form of water-ice just under the surface in the polar regions as well as in briny (salty) water, which seasonally flows down some hillsides and crater walls. Atmosphere Mars has a thin atmosphere made up mostly of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and argon gases.

And because the atmosphere is so thin, heat from the Sun easily escapes this planet. If you were to stand on the surface of Mars on the equator at noon, it would feel like spring at your feet (75 degrees Fahrenheit or 24 degrees Celsius) and winter at your head (32 degrees Fahrenheit or 0 degrees Celsius).\\n\\nOccasionally, winds on Mars are strong enough to create dust storms that cover much of the planet.

Size and Distance With a radius of 2,106 miles (3,390 kilometers), Mars is about half the size of Earth. If Earth were the size of a nickel, Mars would be about as big as a raspberry.\\n\\nFrom an average distance of 142 million miles (228 million kilometers), Mars is 1.5 astronomical units away from the Sun. One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth. From this distance, it takes sunlight 13 minutes to travel from the Sun to Mars. Orbit and Rotation As Mars orbits the Sun, it completes one rotation every 24.6 hours, which is very similar to one day on Earth (23.9 hours). Martian days are called sols – short for \"solar day.\" A year on Mars lasts 669.6 sols, which is the same as 687 Earth days.\\n\\nMars\\' axis of rotation is tilted 25 degrees with respect to the plane of its orbit around the Sun.

Venus is the third brightest object in the sky after the Sun and Moon. Venus spins slowly in the opposite direction from most planets. \\n\\nVenus is similar in structure and size to Earth, and is sometimes called Earth\\'s evil twin. Its thick atmosphere traps heat in a runaway greenhouse effect, making it the hottest planet in our solar system with surface temperatures hot enough to melt lead.

Atmosphere Venus’ atmosphere is one of extremes. With the hottest surface in the solar system, apart from the Sun itself, Venus is hotter even than the innermost planet, charbroiled Mercury. The atmosphere is mostly carbon dioxide – the same gas driving the greenhouse effect on Venus and Earth – with clouds composed of sulfuric acid. And at the surface, the hot, high-pressure carbon dioxide behaves in a corrosive fashion. But higher up in the atmosphere, temperatures and pressure begin to ease. Magnetosphere Even though Venus is similar in size to Earth and has a similar-sized iron core, the planet does not have its own internally generated magnetic field. Instead, Venus has what is known as an induced magnetic field. This weak magnetic field is created by the interaction of the Sun\\'s magnetic field and the planet\\'s outer atmosphere.

Today a key element of this process could be operating: subduction, or the sliding of one continental “plate” beneath another, which can also trigger volcanoes. Subduction is believed to be the first step in creating plate tectonics.\\n\\nNASA’s Magellan spacecraft, which ended a five-year mission to Venus in 1994, mapped the broiling surface using radar. Magellan saw a land of extreme volcanism – a relatively young surface, one recently reshaped (in geologic terms), and chains of towering mountains. Surface The Soviet Union sent a series of probes to Venus between 1961 and 1984 as part of its Venera program (Venera is Russian for Venus). Ten probes made it to the surface, and a few functioned briefly after landing. The longest survivor lasted two hours; the shortest, 23 minutes. Photos snapped before the landers fried show a barren, dim, and rocky landscape, and a sky that is likely some shade of sulfur yellow.\\n\\nVolcanoes and tectonic forces appear to have erased most traces of the early surface of Venus. Newer computer models indicate the resurfacing may have happened piecemeal over an extended period of time. The average age of surface features could be as young as 150 million years, with some older surfaces mixed in.\\n\\nVenus has valleys and high mountains dotted with thousands of volcanoes. Its surface features – most named for both real and mythical women – include Ishtar Terra, a rocky, highland area around the size of Australia near the north pole, and an even larger, South-America-sized region called Aphrodite Terra that stretches across the equator.

Nasser suggested that Skiff request that the IAU officially name the asteroid Zoozve. Skiff agreed, and the name Zoozve was approved in February 2024. Rings Venus has no rings. Formation A critical question for scientists who search for life among the stars: How do habitable planets get their start? The close similarities of early Venus and Earth, and their very different fates, provide a kind of test case for scientists who study planet formation. Similar size, similar interior structure, both harboring oceans in their younger days. Yet one is now an inferno, while the other is the only known world to host abundant life. The factors that set these planets on almost opposite paths began, most likely, in the swirling disk of gas and dust from which they were born. Somehow, 4.6 billion years ago that disk around our Sun accreted, cooled, and settled into the planets we know today. Better knowledge of the formation history of Venus could help us better understand Earth – and rocky planets around other stars. Structure If we could slice Venus and Earth in half, pole to pole, and place them side by side, they would look remarkably similar. Each planet has an iron core enveloped by a hot-rock mantle; the thinnest of skins forms a rocky, exterior crust. On both planets, this thin skin changes form and sometimes erupts into volcanoes in response to the ebb and flow of heat and pressure deep beneath.\\n\\nOn Earth, the slow movement of continents over thousands and millions of years reshapes the surface, a process known as “\\n\\n## Connections Between Identified Themes\\n\\n- **KAREN MEECH** --[Karen Meech is stated to be of the Institute for Astronomy in Hawaii.]--> **HAWAII**\\n\\n- **MARS** --[Mars has a thin atmosphere.]--> **MARS\\'S ATMOSPHERE**\\n\\n- **ERIS** --[The dwarf planet Eris was formerly known by the provisional designation 2003 UB313.]--> **2003 UB313**\\n\\n- **NEAR SHOEMAKER** --[The scientific instruments were onboard the NEAR Shoemaker spacecraft and remained operational after landing.]--> **NEAR SHOEMAKER\\'S INSTRUMENTS**\\n\\n- **HAUMEA** --[Haumea takes 285 Earth years to make one trip around the Sun.]--> **SUN**',\n",

Atmosphere Mars has a thin atmosphere made up mostly of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and argon gases. To our eyes, the sky would be hazy and red because of suspended dust instead of the familiar blue tint we see on Earth. Mars\\' sparse atmosphere doesn\\'t offer much protection from impacts by such objects as meteorites, asteroids, and comets.\\nThe temperature on Mars can be as high as 70 degrees Fahrenheit (20 degrees Celsius) or as low as about -225 degrees Fahrenheit (-153 degrees Celsius). And because the atmosphere is so thin, heat from the Sun easily escapes this planet. If you were to stand on the surface of Mars on the equator at noon, it would feel like spring at your feet (75 degrees Fahrenheit or 24 degrees Celsius) and winter at your head (32 degrees Fahrenheit or 0 degrees Celsius).\\nOccasionally, winds on Mars are strong enough to create dust storms that cover much of the planet. After such storms, it can be months before all of the dust settles. Magnetosphere Mars has no global magnetic field today, but areas of the Martian crust in the southern hemisphere are highly magnetized, indicating traces of a magnetic field from 4 billion years ago.\\nKeep Exploring Discover\\n\\n## From: Solar_System\\nBooks * STEM Multimedia * NASA+ Search Suggested Searches Climate Change Artemis Expedition 64 Mars perseverance SpaceX Crew-2 International

This temperature range could accommodate Earthly life, such as “extremophile” microbes. And atmospheric pressure at that height is similar to what we find on Earth’s surface.\\nAt the tops of Venus’ clouds, whipped around the planet by winds measured as high as 224 mph (360 kph), we find another transformation. Persistent, dark streaks appear. Scientists are so far unable to explain why these streaks remain stubbornly intact, even amid hurricane-force winds. They also have the odd habit of absorbing ultraviolet radiation.\\nThe most likely explanations focus on fine particles, ice crystals, or even a chemical compound called iron chloride. Although it\\'s much less likely, another possibility considered by scientists who study astrobiology is that these streaks could be made up of microbial life, Venus-style. Astrobiologists note that ring-shaped linkages of sulfur atoms, known to exist in Venus’ atmosphere, could provide microbes with a kind of coating that would protect them from sulfuric acid. These handy chemical cloaks would also absorb potentially damaging ultraviolet light and re-radiate it as visible light.\\nSome of the Russian Venera probes did, indeed, detect particles in Venus’ lower atmosphere about a micron in length – roughly the same size as a bacterium on Earth.\\nNone of these findings provide compelling evidence for the existence of life in Venus’ clouds. But the questions they raise, along with Venus’ vanished ocean, its violently volcanic surface, and its hellish history, make a compelling case for missions to investigate our temperamental sister planet. There is much, it would seem, that she can teach us. Size and Distance Venus orbits the Sun from an average distance of 67 million miles (108 million kilometers), or 0.72 astronomical units. One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth. From this distance, it takes sunlight about six minutes\\n### Context related to: LEWIS AND CLARK (Top Chunk Score: 0.838)\\nest impact craters of any rocky planet.\\nOther notable features of the Venus landscape include:\\n  * A volcanic crater named Sacajawea for Lewis and Clark’s Native American guide.\\n  * A deep canyon called Diana for the Roman goddess of the hunt.\\n  * “Pancake” domes with flat tops and steep sides, as wide as 38 miles (62 kilometers), likely formed by the extrusion of highly viscous lava.\\n  * “Tick” domes, odd volcanoes with radiating spurs that, from above, make them look like their blood-feeding namesake.\\n  * Tesserae, terrain with intricate patterns of ridges and grooves that suggest the scorching temperatures make rock behave in some ways more like peanut butter beneath a thin and strong chocolate layer on Venus. Atmosphere Venus’ atmosphere is one of extremes. With the hottest surface in the solar system, apart from the Sun itself, Venus is hotter even than the innermost planet, charbroiled Mercury. The atmosphere is mostly carbon dioxide – the same gas driving the greenhouse effect on Venus and Earth – with clouds composed of sulfuric acid. And at the surface, the hot, high-pressure carbon dioxide behaves in a corrosive fashion. But higher up in the atmosphere, temperatures and pressure begin to ease. Magnetosphere Even though Venus is similar in size to Earth and has a similar-sized iron core, the planet does not have its own internally generated magnetic field. Instead, Venus has what is known as an induced magnetic field. This weak magnetic field is created by the interaction of the Sun\\'s magnetic field and the planet\\'s outer atmosphere. Ultraviolet light from the Sun excites gases in Venus\\' outermost atmosphere; these electrically excited gases are called ions, and thus this region is called the ionosphere (Earth has an ionosphere as well).

Nasser suggested that Skiff request that the IAU officially name the asteroid Zoozve. Skiff agreed, and the name Zoozve was approved in February 2024. Rings Venus has no rings. Formation A critical question for scientists who search for life among the stars: How do habitable planets get their start? The close similarities of early Venus and Earth, and their very different fates, provide a kind of test case for scientists who study planet formation. Similar size, similar interior structure, both harboring oceans in their younger days. Yet one is now an inferno, while the other is the only known world to host abundant life. The factors that set these planets on almost opposite paths began, most likely, in the swirling disk of gas and dust from which they were born. Somehow, 4.6 billion years ago that disk around our Sun accreted, cooled, and settled into the planets we know today. Better knowledge of the formation history of Venus could help us better understand Earth – and rocky planets around other stars. Structure If we could slice Venus and Earth in half, pole to pole, and place them side by side, they would look remarkably similar. Each planet has an iron core enveloped by a hot-rock mantle; the thinnest of skins forms a rocky, exterior crust. On both planets, this thin skin changes form and sometimes erupts into volcanoes in response to the ebb and flow of heat and pressure deep beneath.\\nOn Earth, the slow movement of continents over thousands and millions of years reshapes the surface, a process known as “\\n### Context related to: ORION (Top Chunk Score: 0.824)\\nticas article 2 months ago 1 min read Mejores imágenes de Ciencia en la estación espacial 2024 article 3 months ago 11 min read La NASA identifica causa de pérdida de material del escudo térmico de Orion de Artemis I article 5 months ago Explore Mars In Depth\\n  1. … 2.

Venus is the third brightest object in the sky after the Sun and Moon. Venus spins slowly in the opposite direction from most planets. \\nVenus is similar in structure and size to Earth, and is sometimes called Earth\\'s evil twin. Its thick atmosphere traps heat in a runaway greenhouse effect, making it the hottest planet in our solar system with surface temperatures hot enough to melt lead. Below the dense, persistent clouds, the surface has volcanoes and deformed mountains. Namesake The ancient Romans could easily see seven bright objects in the sky: the Sun, the Moon, and the five brightest planets: Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. They named the objects after their most important gods. \\nVenus is named for the ancient Roman goddess of love and beauty, who was known as Aphrodite to the ancient Greeks. Most features on Venus are named for women. It’s the only planet named after a female god.

One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth. From this distance, it takes sunlight 6 hours and 20 minutes to travel from the Sun to Makemake. Orbit and Rotation Makemake takes 305 Earth years to make one trip around the Sun. As Makemake orbits the Sun, it completes one rotation every 22 and a half hours, making its day length similar to Earth and Mars. Moons This Hubble image reveals the first moon ever discovered around dwarf planet Makemake.

It was the first member of the asteroid belt to be discovered when Giuseppe Piazzi spotted it in 1801. When NASA\\'s Dawn arrived in 2015, Ceres became the first dwarf planet to receive a visit from a spacecraft.\\n\\nCalled an asteroid for many years, Ceres is so much bigger and so different from its rocky neighbors that scientists classified it as a dwarf planet in 2006. Even though Ceres comprises 25% of the asteroid belt\\'s total mass, Pluto is still 14 times more massive. Namesake Ceres is named for the Roman goddess of corn and harvests. The word cereal comes from the same name. Potential for Life Ceres is one of the few places in our solar system where scientists would like to search for possible signs of life. Ceres has something a lot of other planets don\\'t: water. Here on Earth, water is essential for life, so it\\'s possible someplace else with that ingredient and a few other conditions could support life, as well. If anything does live on Ceres, it\\'s likely to be very small microbes similar to bacteria. If Ceres does not have living things today, there may be signs it harbored life in the past.

The mountains are big blocks of water ice, sometimes with a coating of frozen gases like methane. Long troughs and valleys as long as 370 miles (600 kilometers) add to the interesting features of this faraway dwarf planet.\\n\\nCraters as large as 162 miles (260 kilometers) in diameter dot some of the landscape on Pluto, with some showing signs of erosion and filling. This suggests tectonic forces are slowly resurfacing Pluto.\\n\\nThe most prominent plains observed on Pluto appear to be made of frozen nitrogen gas and show no craters. These plains do show structures suggesting convection (blobs of material circulating up and down). Atmosphere Pluto has a thin, tenuous atmosphere that expands when it comes closer to the Sun and collapses as it moves farther away – similar to a comet. The main constituent is molecular nitrogen, though molecules of methane and carbon monoxide have also been detected.\\n\\nWhen Pluto is close to the Sun, its surface ices sublimate (changing directly from solid to gas) and rise to temporarily form a thin atmosphere. Pluto\\'s low gravity (about 6% of Earth\\'s) causes the atmosphere to be much more extended in altitude than our planet\\'s atmosphere. Pluto becomes much colder during the part of each year when it is traveling far away from the Sun. During this time, the bulk of the planet\\'s atmosphere may freeze and fall as snow to the surface.

Orbit and Rotation Eris takes 557 Earth years to make one trip around the Sun. The plane of Eris\\' orbit is well out of the plane of the solar system\\'s planets and extends far beyond the Kuiper Belt, a zone of icy debris beyond the orbit of Neptune.\\n\\nAs Eris orbits the Sun, it completes one rotation every 25.9 hours, making its day length similar to ours. Moons Eris has a very small moon called Dysnomia. Dysnomia has a nearly circular orbit lasting about 16 days. This moon is named after Eris\\' daughter, the demon goddess of lawlessness.\\n\\nDysnomia and other small moons around planets and dwarf planets allow astronomers to calculate the mass of the parent body. Dysnomia plays a role in determining how comparable Pluto and Eris are to each other. Rings Eris has no known rings. Formation Dwarf planet Eris is a member of a group of objects that orbit in a disc-like zone beyond the orbit of Neptune called the Kuiper Belt. This distant realm is populated with thousands of miniature icy worlds, which formed early in the history of our solar system about 4.5 billion years ago. These icy, rocky bodies are called Kuiper Belt objects, transneptunian objects, or plutoids. Structure We know very little about Eris\\' internal structure. Surface Eris most likely has a rocky surface similar to Pluto.

Formation Ceres formed along with the rest of the solar system about 4.5 billion years ago when gravity pulled swirling gas and dust in to become a small dwarf planet. Scientists describe Ceres as an \"embryonic planet,\" which means it started to form but didn\\'t quite finish. Nearby Jupiter\\'s strong gravity prevented it from becoming a fully formed planet. About 4 billion years ago, Ceres settled into its current location among the leftover pieces of planetary formation in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. Structure Ceres is more similar to the terrestrial planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars) than its asteroid neighbors, but it is much less dense. One of the similarities is a layered interior, but Ceres\\' layers aren’t as clearly defined. Ceres probably has a solid core and a mantle made of water ice. In fact, Ceres could be composed of as much as 25 percent water. If that is correct, Ceres has more water than Earth does. Ceres\\' crust is rocky and dusty with large salt deposits. The salts on Ceres aren’t like table salt (sodium chloride), but instead are made of different minerals like magnesium sulfate. Surface Ceres is covered in countless small, young craters, but none are larger than 175 miles (280 kilometers) in diameter. This is surprising, given that the dwarf planet must have been hit by numerous large asteroids during its 4.5 billion-year lifetime.\\n\\nThe lack of craters might be due to layers of ice just below the surface.

It also mentions the possible formation of the moon system.\\n\\n Sun is unusual compared to the planets: it\\'s both elliptical and tilted. Pluto\\'s 248-year-long, oval-shaped orbit can take it as far as 49.3 astronomical units (AU) from the Sun, and as close as 30 AU. (One AU is the mean distance between Earth and the Sun: about 93 million miles or 150 million kilometers.) But on average, Pluto is 3.7 billion miles (5.9 billion kilometers) away from the Sun, or 39 AU.\\n\\nFrom 1979 to 1999, Pluto was near perihelion, when it is closest to the Sun. During this time, Pluto was actually closer to the Sun than Neptune.\\n\\nOne day on Pluto takes about 153 hours. Its axis of rotation is tilted 57 degrees with respect to the plane of its orbit around the Sun, so it spins almost on its side. Pluto also exhibits a retrograde rotation; spinning from east to west like Venus and Uranus. Moons Pluto has five known moons: Charon, Nix, Hydra, Kerberos, and Styx. This moon system might have formed by a collision between Pluto and another similar-sized body early in the history of the solar system.\\n\\nCharon, the biggest of Pluto\\'s moons, is about half the size of Pluto itself, making it the largest satellite relative to the planet it orbits in our solar system. It orbits Pluto at a distance of just 12,200 miles (19,640 kilometers). For comparison, our Moon is 20 times farther away from Earth.

At that small size, Pluto is only about half the width of the United States. It\\'s about 3.6 billion miles away from the Sun, and it has a thin atmosphere composed mostly of nitrogen, methane, and carbon monoxide. On average, Pluto’s temperature is -387°F (-232°C), making it too cold to sustain life.\\n\\nPluto is orbited by five known moons, the largest of which is Charon. Charon is about half the size of Pluto itself, making it the largest satellite relative to the planet it orbits in our solar system. Pluto and Charon are often referred to as a \"double planet.\"\\n\\nThe only spacecraft to explore Pluto up close was NASA\\'s New Horizons. It flew by the dwarf planet and its moons in 2015.

They\\'re also irregularly shaped, not spherical like Charon. Unlike many other moons in the solar system, these moons are not tidally locked to Pluto. They all spin and don’t keep the same face towards Pluto.\\n\\nPluto\\'s moons are named for other mythological figures associated with the underworld. Charon is named for the river Styx boatman who ferries souls in the underworld (as well as honoring Charlene, the wife of discoverer James Christy, who was nicknamed Char). The small moon Nix is named for the goddess of darkness and night, who is also the mother of Charon. Hydra is named for the nine-headed serpent that guards the underworld. Kerberos is named after the three-headed dog of Greek mythology (known as Fluffy in the Harry Potter novels). And Styx is named for the mythological river that separates the world of the living from the realm of the dead. Rings There are no known rings around Pluto. Formation Dwarf planet Pluto is a member of a group of objects that orbit in a disc-like zone beyond the orbit of Neptune called the Kuiper Belt. This distant realm is populated with thousands of miniature icy worlds, which formed early in the history of our solar system about 4.5 billion years ago. These icy, rocky bodies are called Kuiper Belt objects, transneptunian objects, or plutoids.

The International Astronomical Union’s Gazetteer of Planetary Nomenclature lists the discovery location as Sierra Nevada Observatory in Spain on March 7, 2003, but no official discoverer is listed. Haumea is named after the Hawaiian goddess of fertility. Potential for Life Haumea is extremely cold and doesn\\'t appear to have conditions suitable for life. Size and Distance With an equatorial diameter of about 1,080 miles (about 1,740 kilometers), Haumea is about 1/7 the width of Earth. If Earth were the size of a nickel, Haumea would be about as big as a sesame seed. From an average distance of 4 billion miles (6.5 billion kilometers), Haumea is 43 astronomical units away from the Sun. One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth. From this distance, it takes sunlight 6 hours to travel from the Sun to Haumea. O rbit and Rotation Haumea takes 285 Earth years to make one trip around the Sun. As Haumea orbits the Sun, it completes one rotation every 4 hours, making it one of the fastest rotating large objects in our solar system.\\n\\nIt is possible that a large object impacted Haumea billions of years ago and set off Haumea\\'s spin and created its moons.

It also discusses Kuiper Belt objects and binaries, which is relevant to the context of dwarf planets.\\n\\n Neptune, Pluto makes two orbits. In this situation, Pluto never comes close enough to Neptune to be affected much by its gravity. In fact, even though its orbit crosses Neptune\\'s orbit, Pluto gets physically closer to Uranus than it ever does to Neptune. Kuiper Belt Moons and Binaries A fairly large number of KBOs either have moons – that is, significantly smaller bodies that orbit them – or are binary objects. Binaries are pairs of objects that are relatively similar in size or mass that orbit around a point – a shared center of mass – that lies between them. Some binaries actually touch, creating a sort of peanut shape, creating what\\'s known as a contact binary.\\n\\nThe small Kuiper Belt Object called Arrokoth is a contact binary. It was discovered in 2014 by NASA’s New Horizons science team, using the Hubble Space Telescope. NASA\\'s New Horizons spacecraft flew by Arrokoth on Jan. 1, 2019, snapping images that showed a double-lobed object that looked like a partially flattened red snowman. Arrokoth is the most distant and the most primitive object ever explored by a spacecraft. NASA\\'s New Horizons spacecraft flew past Arrokoth on New Year\\'s 2019, nearly four years after its historic flight through the Pluto system on July 14, 2015.\\n\\nDwarf planets Pluto, Eris, Haumea, and Makemake are all Kuiper Belt objects that have moons.\\n\\nOne thing that makes binary KBOs particularly interesting is that most of them may be extremely ancient, or primordial, objects that have been altered little since their formation. The various ideas for how these pairs form require a lot more objects than the present-day Kuiper Belt appears to contain. One leading idea is that binaries may result from low-speed collisions between KBOs, which would allow them to survive the impact and stick together due to their mutual gravity. Such collisions were likely much more\\n\\n## Connections Between Identified Themes\\n\\n- **VESTA** --[instance of]--> **ASTEROID**\\n\\n- **EUNIKE** --[instance of]--> **ASTEROID**\\n\\n- **2024 YR4** --[instance of]--> **ASTEROID**\\n\\n- **DINKINESH** --[instance of]--> **ASTEROID**\\n\\n- **PLANET** --[instance of]--> **URANUS**',\n",

This distant realm is populated with thousands of miniature icy worlds which formed early in the history of our solar system about 4.5 billion years ago. These icy, rocky bodies are called Kuiper Belt objects, transneptunian objects, or plutoids. Structure Astronomers believe Haumea is made of rock with a coating of ice.

NASA’s Dawn spacecraft circled Vesta from July 16, 2011, until Sept. 5, 2012, when it departed and began its journey to dwarf planet Ceres.\\nThe giant asteroid is almost spherical, and so is nearly classified a dwarf planet. Unlike most known asteroids, Vesta has separated into crust, mantle and core (a characteristic known as being differentiated), much like Earth.\\nUnderstanding why this is so was one of the objectives of the Dawn mission. The answer turned out to be that Vesta formed early, within 1 to 2 million years of the birth of the solar system.

That means it spins nearly perfectly upright and doesn\\'t experience seasons like other more tilted planets do. Moons Ceres does not have any moons. Rings Ceres does not have any rings. Formation Ceres formed along with the rest of the solar system about 4.5 billion years ago when gravity pulled swirling gas and dust in to become a small dwarf planet. Scientists describe Ceres as an \"embryonic planet,\" which means it started to form but didn\\'t quite finish. Nearby Jupiter\\'s strong gravity prevented it from becoming a fully formed planet. About 4 billion years ago, Ceres settled into its current location among the leftover pieces of planetary formation in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. Structure Ceres is more similar to the terrestrial planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars) than its asteroid neighbors, but it is much less dense. One of the similarities is a layered interior, but Ceres\\' layers aren’t as clearly defined. Ceres probably has a solid core and a mantle made of water ice. In fact, Ceres could be composed of as much as 25 percent water. If that is correct, Ceres has more water than Earth does. Ceres\\' crust is rocky and dusty with large salt deposits. The salts on Ceres aren’t like table salt (sodium chloride), but instead are made of different minerals like magnesium sulfate. Surface Ceres is covered in countless small, young craters, but none are larger than 175 miles (280 kilometers) in diameter. This is surprising, given that the dwarf planet must have been hit by numerous large asteroids during its 4.5 billion-year lifetime.\\nThe lack of craters might be due to layers of ice just below the surface. The surface features could smooth out over time if ice\\n### Context related to: POTENTIAL FOR LIFE (Top Chunk Score: 0.825)\\nris, the International Astronomical Union votes to change the definition of a planet.

Both Eris and the asteroid Ceres are also classified as dwarf planets.\\n  * Sep 14, 2006: The International Astronomical Union (IAU) announces that the dwarf planet known as Xena will be called Eris, after the Greek goddess of discord. Eris\\'s moon is named Dysnomia, the demon goddess of lawlessness and the daughter of Eris. This is fitting since the discovery of Eris led to the demotion of Pluto from planet to dwarf planet amidst continuing debate in the science community and the public. Namesake This image of dwarf planet Eris (also known as 2003 UB313 or Xena,) was taken using the Samuel Oschin Telescope at the Palomar Observatory.\\nOriginally designated 2003 UB313 – and nicknamed for the television warrior Xena by its discovery team – Eris is named for the ancient Greek goddess of discord and strife. The name fits since Eris remains at the center of a scientific debate about the definition of a planet. Potential for Life The surface of Eris is extremely cold, so it seems unlikely that life could exist there. Size and Distance With an equatorial diameter of about 1,500 miles (2,400 kilometers), Eris is about 1/5 the width of Earth. Eris, like Pluto, is a little smaller than Earth\\'s Moon. If the Earth were the size of a nickel, Eris would be about as big as a popcorn kernel.\\nFrom an average distance of 6.3 billion miles (10 billion kilometers), Eris is about 68 astronomical units away from the Sun.

One of the similarities is a layered interior, but Ceres\\' layers aren’t as clearly defined. Ceres probably has a solid core and a mantle made of water ice. In fact, Ceres could be composed of as much as 25 percent water. If that is correct, Ceres has more water than Earth does. Ceres\\' crust is rocky and dusty with large salt deposits. The salts on Ceres aren’t like table salt (sodium chloride), but instead are made of different minerals like magnesium sulfate. Surface Ceres is covered in countless small, young craters, but none are larger than 175 miles (280 kilometers) in diameter. This is surprising, given that the dwarf planet must have been hit by numerous large asteroids during its 4.5 billion-year lifetime.\\n\\nThe lack of craters might be due to layers of ice just below the surface.

This suggests tectonic forces are slowly resurfacing Pluto.\\n\\nThe most prominent plains observed on Pluto appear to be made of frozen nitrogen gas and show no craters. These plains do show structures suggesting convection (blobs of material circulating up and down). Atmosphere Pluto has a thin, tenuous atmosphere that expands when it comes closer to the Sun and collapses as it moves farther away – similar to a comet. The main constituent is molecular nitrogen, though molecules of methane and carbon monoxide have also been detected.\\n\\nWhen Pluto is close to the Sun, its surface ices sublimate (changing directly from solid to gas) and rise to temporarily form a thin atmosphere. Pluto\\'s low gravity (about 6% of Earth\\'s) causes the atmosphere to be much more extended in altitude than our planet\\'s atmosphere. Pluto becomes much colder during the part of each year when it is traveling far away from the Sun. During this time, the bulk of the planet\\'s atmosphere may freeze and fall as snow to the surface.

It also discusses Kuiper Belt objects and binaries, providing context for the location of some dwarf planets.\\n\\n Neptune, Pluto makes two orbits. In this situation, Pluto never comes close enough to Neptune to be affected much by its gravity. In fact, even though its orbit crosses Neptune\\'s orbit, Pluto gets physically closer to Uranus than it ever does to Neptune. Kuiper Belt Moons and Binaries A fairly large number of KBOs either have moons – that is, significantly smaller bodies that orbit them – or are binary objects. Binaries are pairs of objects that are relatively similar in size or mass that orbit around a point – a shared center of mass – that lies between them. Some binaries actually touch, creating a sort of peanut shape, creating what\\'s known as a contact binary.\\n\\nThe small Kuiper Belt Object called Arrokoth is a contact binary. It was discovered in 2014 by NASA’s New Horizons science team, using the Hubble Space Telescope. NASA\\'s New Horizons spacecraft flew by Arrokoth on Jan. 1, 2019, snapping images that showed a double-lobed object that looked like a partially flattened red snowman. Arrokoth is the most distant and the most primitive object ever explored by a spacecraft.

The various ideas for how these pairs form require a lot more objects than the present-day Kuiper Belt appears to contain. One leading idea is that binaries may result from low-speed collisions between KBOs, which would allow them to survive the impact and stick together due to their mutual gravity.

Pluto\\'s 248-year-long, oval-shaped orbit can take it as far as 49.3 astronomical units (AU) from the Sun, and as close as 30 AU. (One AU is the mean distance between Earth and the Sun: about 93 million miles or 150 million kilometers.) But on average, Pluto is 3.7 billion miles (5.9 billion kilometers) away from the Sun, or 39 AU.\\n\\nFrom 1979 to 1999, Pluto was near perihelion, when it is closest to the Sun. During this time, Pluto was actually closer to the Sun than Neptune.\\n\\nOne day on Pluto takes about 153 hours. Its axis of rotation is tilted 57 degrees with respect to the plane of its orbit around the Sun, so it spins almost on its side. Pluto also exhibits a retrograde rotation; spinning from east to west like Venus and Uranus. Moons Pluto has five known moons: Charon, Nix, Hydra, Kerberos, and Styx. This moon system might have formed by a collision between Pluto and another similar-sized body early in the history of the solar system.\\n\\nCharon, the biggest of Pluto\\'s moons, is about half the size of Pluto itself, making it the largest satellite relative to the planet it orbits in our solar system.

Orbit and Rotation Eris takes 557 Earth years to make one trip around the Sun. The plane of Eris\\' orbit is well out of the plane of the solar system\\'s planets and extends far beyond the Kuiper Belt, a zone of icy debris beyond the orbit of Neptune.\\nAs Eris orbits the Sun, it completes one rotation every 25.9 hours, making its day length similar to ours. Moons Eris has a very small moon called Dysnomia. Dysnomia has a nearly circular orbit lasting about 16 days. This moon is named after Eris\\' daughter, the demon goddess of lawlessness.\\nDysnomia and other small moons around planets and dwarf planets allow astronomers to calculate the mass of the parent body. Dysnomia plays a role in determining how comparable Pluto and Eris are to each other. Rings Eris has no known rings. Formation Dwarf planet Eris is a member of a group of objects that orbit in a disc-like zone beyond the orbit of Neptune called the Kuiper Belt. This distant realm is populated with thousands of miniature icy worlds, which formed early in the history of our solar system about 4.5 billion years ago. These icy, rocky bodies are called Kuiper Belt objects, transneptunian objects, or plutoids. Structure We know very little about Eris\\' internal structure. Surface Eris most likely has a rocky surface similar to Pluto. Scientists think surface temperatures vary from about -359 degrees Fahrenheit (-217 degrees Celsius) to -405 degrees Fahrenheit (-243 degrees Celsius). Atmosphere The dwarf planet is often so far from the Sun that its atmosphere collapses and freezes, falling to the surface as snow. As it gets closest to the Sun in its faraway orbit, the atmosphere thaws. Magnetosphere Nothing is known about Eris\\' magnetosphere.\\none of nine? more or less? What is a Planet? Pluto fans\\n 4.5 billion years ago. These icy, rocky bodies are called Kuiper Belt objects, transneptunian objects, or plutoids. Structure Scientists know very little about Makemake\\'s structure. Surface We can\\'t see too many details of Makemake\\'s surface from so far away, but it does appear to be a reddish-brownish color, similar to Pluto. Scientists have also detected frozen methane and ethane on its surface. In fact, pellets of frozen methane as big as half an inch (1 centimeter) in diameter may rest on Makemake\\'s cold surface. Atmosphere Makemake may develop a very thin atmosphere, most likely made of nitrogen, near perihelion – when it is closest to the Sun. Magnetosphere Scientists do not know if Makemake has a magnetosphere.\\nKeep Exploring Discover More Topics From NASA Sun Planets Asteroids, Comets & Meteors Kuiper Belt National Aeronautics and Space Administration NASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery.\\n  * About NASA\\'s Mission Join Us * Home * News & Events * Multimedia * NASA+ * Missions * Humans in Space * Earth * The Solar System * The Universe * Science * Aeronautics * Technology * Learning Resources * About NASA * NASA en Español Follow NASA More NASA Social Accounts NASA Newsletters Sitemap For Media Privacy Policy FOIA No FEAR Act Office of the IG Budget & Annual Reports Agency Financial Reports Contact NASA Accessibility Page Last Updated: \\nApr 24, 2025 Page Editor: \\nAMANDA BARNETT Responsible NASA Official for Science: \\nDana Bolles\\n* Explore Search * News & Events ### News & Events * Recently Published * Video Series on NASA+ * Podcasts * Blogs * Newsletters * Social Media * Media Resources * Multimedia ### Multimedia * Images * Videos on NASA\\n Missions A to Z List of Missions Upcoming Launches and Landings Spaceships and Rockets Communicating with Missions Artemis James Webb Space Telescope Hubble Space Telescope International Space Station OSIRIS-REx Humans in Space Why Go to Space Astronauts Commercial Space Destinations Spaceships and Rockets Living in Space Earth Explore Earth Science Climate Change Earth, Our Planet Earth Science in Action Earth Multimedia Earth Data Earth Science Researchers The Solar System The Sun Mercury Venus Earth The Moon Mars Jupiter Saturn Uranus Neptune Pluto & Dwarf Planets Asteroids, Comets & Meteors The Kuiper Belt The Oort Cloud Skywatching The Universe Exoplanets The Search for Life in the Universe Stars Galaxies Black Holes The Big Bang Dark Matter Dark Energy Science Earth Science Planetary Science Astrophysics & Space Science The Sun & Heliophysics Biological & Physical Sciences Lunar Science Citizen Science Astromaterials Aeronautics Research Human Space Travel Research Aeronautics Science in the Air NASA Aircraft Flight Innovation Supersonic Flight Air Traffic Solutions Green Aviation Tech Drones & You Technology Technology Transfer & Spinoffs Space Travel Technology Technology Living in Space Manufacturing and Materials Robotics Science Instruments Computing Learning Resources For Kids and Students For Educators For Colleges and Universities For Professionals Science for Everyone Requests for Exhibits, Artifacts, or Speakers STEM Engagement at NASA About NASA NASA\\'s Impacts Centers and Facilities Directorates Organizations People of NASA Careers Internships Our History Doing Business with NASA Get Involved Contact NASA en Español Ciencia Aeronáutica Ciencias Terrestres Sistema Solar Universo News & Events Recently Published Video Series on NASA+ Podcasts Blogs Newsletters Social Media Media Resources Multimedia Images Videos on NASA+ Sounds and Ringtones Interactives NASA Apps Podcasts e-Books STEM Multimedia Highlights 2 min read Hubble Images a Peculiar Spiral article 3 days ago 6 min read NASA’s SPHEREx Space Telescope Begins\\n### Context related to: JAMES WEBB SPACE TELESCOPE (Top Chunk Score: 0.832)\\n: NASA Brings Exploration to FIRST Robotics 2025  article 5 days ago 5 min read NASA’s Lunar Drill Technology Passes Tests on the Moon article 5 days ago 2 min read NASA Technology Enables Leaps in Artificial Intelligence article 5 days ago Highlights 9 min read ARMD Research Solicitations (Updated May 1) article 3 days ago 3 min read NASA Invests in Future STEM Workforce Through Space Grant Awards  article 3 days ago 7 min read ¿Qué es una caminata espacial?

Only dwarf planet Ceres is more massive in that region of rocky debris between Mars and Jupiter. NASA’s Dawn spacecraft circled Vesta from July 16, 2011, until Sept. 5, 2012, when it departed and began its journey to dwarf planet Ceres.\\nThe giant asteroid is almost spherical, and so is nearly classified a dwarf planet. Unlike most known asteroids, Vesta has separated into crust, mantle and core (a characteristic known as being differentiated), much like Earth.\\nUnderstanding why this is so was one of the objectives of the Dawn mission. The answer turned out to be that Vesta formed early, within 1 to 2 million years of the birth of the solar system. Short-lived radioactive material that was incorporated into bodies that formed during this epoch heated them to the point where—in cases like Vesta—the objects melted, allowing the dens\\n### Context related to: PLUTO & DWARF PLANETS (Top Chunk Score: 0.827)\\n Change Earth, Our Planet Earth Science in Action Earth Multimedia Earth Data Earth Science Researchers The Solar System The Sun Mercury Venus Earth The Moon Mars Jupiter Saturn Uranus Neptune Pluto & Dwarf Planets Asteroids, Comets & Meteors The Kuiper Belt The Oort Cloud Skywatching The Universe Exoplanets The Search for Life in the Universe Stars Galaxies Black Holes The Big Bang Dark Matter Dark Energy Science Earth Science Planetary Science Astrophysics & Space Science The Sun & Heliophysics Biological & Physical Sciences Lunar Science Citizen Science Astromaterials Aeronautics Research Human Space Travel Research Aeronautics Science in the Air NASA Aircraft Flight Innovation Supersonic Flight Air Traffic Solutions Green Aviation Tech Drones & You Technology Technology Transfer & Spinoffs Space Travel Technology Technology Living in Space Manufacturing and Materials Robotics Science Instruments Computing Learning Resources For Kids and Students For Educators For Colleges and Universities For Professionals Science for Everyone Requests for Exhibits, Artifacts, or Speakers STEM Engagement at NASA About NASA NASA\\'s Impacts Centers and Facilities Directorates Organizations People of NASA Careers Internships Our History Doing Business with NASA Get Involved Contact NASA en Español Ciencia Aeronáutica Ciencias Terrestres Sistema Solar Universo News & Events Recently Published Video Series on NASA+ Podcasts Blogs Newsletters Social Media Media Resources Multimedia Images Videos on NASA+ Sounds and Ringtones Interactives NASA Apps Podcasts e-Books STEM Multimedia Highlights 2 min read Hubble Images a Peculiar Spiral article 3 days ago 6 min read NASA’s SPHEREx Space Telescope Begins Capturing Entire Sky article 3 days ago 4 min read NASA’s Chandra Diagnoses Cause of Fracture in Galactic “Bone” article 3 days ago Highlights 1 min read HALO Arrives in the US article 4 days ago 3 min read Lunar Space Station Module for NASA’s Artemis Campaign to\\n NASAarticle3 days ago Back Missions Search All NASA Missions A to Z List of Missions Upcoming Launches and Landings Spaceships and Rockets Communicating with Missions Artemis James Webb Space Telescope Hubble Space Telescope International Space Station OSIRIS-REx Humans in Space Why Go to Space Astronauts Commercial Space Destinations Spaceships and Rockets Living in Space Earth Explore Earth Science Climate Change Earth, Our Planet Earth Science in Action Earth Multimedia Earth Data Earth Science Researchers The Solar System The Sun Mercury Venus Earth The Moon Mars Jupiter Saturn Uranus Neptune Pluto & Dwarf Planets Asteroids, Comets & Meteors The Kuiper Belt The Oort Cloud Skywatching The Universe Exoplanets The Search for Life in the Universe Stars Galaxies Black Holes The Big Bang Dark Matter Dark Energy Science Earth Science Planetary Science Astrophysics & Space Science The Sun & Heliophysics Biological & Physical Sciences Lunar Science Citizen Science Astromaterials Aeronautics Research Human Space Travel Research Aeronautics Science in the Air NASA Aircraft Flight Innovation Supersonic Flight Air Traffic Solutions Green Aviation Tech Drones & You Technology Technology Transfer & Spinoffs Space Travel Technology Technology Living in Space Manufacturing and Materials Robotics Science Instruments Computing Learning Resources For Kids and Students For Educators For Colleges and Universities For Professionals Science for Everyone Requests for Exhibits, Artifacts, or Speakers STEM Engagement at NASA About NASA NASA\\'s Impacts Centers and Facilities Directorates Organizations People of NASA Careers Internships Our History Doing Business with NASA Get Involved Contact NASA en Español Ciencia Aeronáutica Ciencias Terrestres Sistema Solar Universo News & Events Recently Published Video Series on NASA+ Podcasts Blogs Newsletters Social Media Media Resources Multimedia Images Videos on NASA+ Sounds and Ringtones Interactives NASA Apps Podcasts e-Books STEM Multimedia Highlights 2 min read Hubble Images a Peculiar Spiral article 2 days ago 6 min read',\n",
