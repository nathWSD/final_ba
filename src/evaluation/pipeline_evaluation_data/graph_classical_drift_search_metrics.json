Neptune's moon Triton, possibly a captured KBO, was visited by Voyager 2 in 1989, and Saturn's moon Phoebe, another potential captured KBO, was visited by Cassini in 2004.

        "expected_output": "The first Kuiper Belt Object (KBO) discovered was Pluto in 1930, though it wasn't initially recognized as part of a larger population due to its size and brightness relative to later discoveries and the lack of expectation for such a belt. Gerard Kuiper speculated about objects beyond Pluto in 1951, lending his name to the region (sometimes also called the Edgeworth-Kuiper Belt). Kenneth Edgeworth also mentioned such objects in the 1940s. Significant progress occurred in 1992 when David Jewitt and Jane Luu used a large telescope on Mauna Kea equipped with a CCD camera to discover the second KBO, 1992 QB1 (later named Albion). This technological advancement opened the door to finding thousands more KBOs. The first spacecraft to enter the region was Pioneer 10 in 1983, crossing beyond Neptune's orbit. However, NASA's New Horizons was the first mission to visit a KBO, flying past Pluto and its moons in July 2015. It then performed the most distant flyby in history, visiting the KBO Arrokoth (discovered in 2014 using the Hubble Space Telescope) on January 1, 2019, revealing it to be a contact binary and the most primitive object explored by spacecraft.",
        "retrieval_context": "## Detailed Evidence from Sources\n### Context related to: AERONAUTICS (Top Chunk Score: 0.860)\n David Jewitt and Jane Luu attached a CCD camera to a large (2.2-meter) telescope on Mauna Kea in Hawaii, and they quickly detected an object, which was designated 1992 QB1, and later named Albion. Many more discoveries soon followed, with a couple of thousand KBOs being detected over the next quarter-century.\nThe first spacecraft to enter the Kuiper Belt region was NASA's Pioneer 10 spacecraft when it crossed into the space beyond Neptune's orbit in 1983. But the first spacecraft to visit an object in the Kuiper Belt was New Horizons when it flew by Pluto and its moons. New Horizons then went on to visit Arrokoth.\nTwo moons of the giant planets are thought to potentially be objects originally from the Kuiper Belt that became captured long ago. Neptune's largest moon Triton was visited by NASA's Voyager 2 spacecraft in 1989, while Phoebe, a small outer moon of Saturn, was visited by NASA's Cassini spacecraft in 2004. Both of these potential captured Kuiper Belt objects orbit their planets in a direction opposite of the other moons and the planet's rotation, which is a strong indication that they likely were captured objects that strayed too close to the planets.

On Jan. 1, 2019, the spacecraft flew by a Kuiper Belt object later named Arrokoth . In a fitting tribute to the farthest flyby ever conducted by spacecraft, the Kuiper Belt object designated 2014 MU69 was officially named Arrokoth, a Native American term meaning “sky” in the Powhatan/Algonquian language. - More about Arrokoth NASA/Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory/Southwest Research Institute//Roman\n### Context related to: NEPTUNE (Top Chunk Score: 0.837)\n Space Destinations Spaceships and Rockets Living in Space Earth Explore Earth Science Climate Change Earth, Our Planet Earth Science in Action Earth Multimedia Earth Data Earth Science Researchers The Solar System The Sun Mercury Venus Earth The Moon Mars Jupiter Saturn Uranus Neptune Pluto & Dwarf Planets Asteroids, Comets & Meteors The Kuiper Belt The Oort Cloud Skywatching The Universe Exoplanets The Search for Life in the Universe Stars Galaxies Black Holes The Big Bang Dark Matter Dark Energy Science Earth Science Planetary Science Astrophysics & Space Science The Sun & Heliophysics Biological & Physical Sciences Lunar Science Citizen Science Astromaterials Aeronautics Research Human Space Travel Research Aeronautics Science in the Air NASA Aircraft Flight Innovation Supersonic Flight Air Traffic Solutions Green Aviation Tech Drones & You Technology Technology Transfer & Spinoffs Space Travel Technology Technology Living in Space Manufacturing and Materials Robotics Science Instruments Computing Learning Resources For Kids and Students For Educators For Colleges and Universities For Professionals Science for Everyone Requests for Exhibits, Artifacts, or Speakers STEM Engagement at NASA About NASA NASA's Impacts Centers and Facilities Directorates Organizations People of NASA Careers Internships Our History Doing Business with NASA Get Involved Contact NASA en Español Ciencia Aeronáutica Ciencias Terrestres Sistema Solar Universo News & Events Recently Published Video Series on NASA+ Podcasts Blogs Newsletters Social Media Media Resources Multimedia Images Videos on NASA+ Sounds and Ringtones Interactives NASA Apps Podcasts e-Books STEM Multimedia Highlights 2 min read Hubble Images a Peculiar Spiral article 2 days ago 6 min read NASA’s SPHEREx Space Telescope Begins Capturing Entire Sky article 3 days ago 4 min read NASA’s Chandra Diagnoses Cause of Fracture in Galactic “Bone” article 3 days ago Highlights 1 min read HALO Arrives in the US article 4 days ago\n### Context related to: EDGEWORTH-KUIPER BELT (Top Chunk Score: 0.835)\n/Southwest Research Institute//Roman Tkachenko\nThis flyby was the most distant in the history of space exploration, a billion miles beyond Pluto. The first Kuiper Belt Object –1992 QB1 – was discovered in 1992 by astronomers David Jewitt and Janet Luui.\nEuropean Southern Observatory History In 1930, Pluto became the first Kuiper Belt object to be discovered. It would be another 62 years until the second one was known. This had a lot to do with the fact that KBOs are quite far away from Earth and generally quite dark. Pluto has a rather bright, reflective surface, compared to many other KBOs, as well as its large size. These qualities made Pluto easier to detect with the telescopes available in the early 20th century. At the time, scientists had not yet developed ideas about the outer solar system that suggested Pluto might have a lot of company. So, despite its oddly elliptical and tilted orbit, it made sense at the time to think of Pluto as a planet.\nThe Kuiper Belt is named for astronomer Gerard Kuiper, who published a scientific paper in 1951 that speculated about objects beyond Pluto. Kuiper's work didn't actually predict the populations of objects we observe in the region named for him, or, crucially, their relationship with Neptune. But he and his ideas were well-known among astronomers such that the general idea of the belt came to be attributed to him. Astronomer Kenneth Edgeworth also briefly mentioned objects beyond Pluto in papers he published in the 1940s, and thus the region is sometimes referred to as the Edgeworth-Kuiper Belt. Other astronomers also speculated that there might be undiscovered icy bodies beyond Neptune, but none were confirmed until 1992.\nBy the early 1990s, scientists had access to new tools that were unavailable to Pluto's discoverer, Clyde Tombaugh, in the 1930s. In 1992, astronomers David Jewitt and Jane Luu\n 1) article 3 days ago 3 min read NASA Invests in Future STEM Workforce Through Space Grant Awards  article 3 days ago 7 min read ¿Qué es una caminata espacial?

Astronomers think there are millions of small, icy objects in this region – including hundreds of thousands that are larger than 60 miles (100 kilometers) wide. Some of the objects, including Pluto, are over 600 miles (1,000 kilometers) wide. In addition to rock and water ice, objects in the Kuiper Belt also contain a variety of other frozen compounds like ammonia and methane.\nSimilar to the asteroid belt, the Kuiper Belt is a region of leftovers from the solar system's early history. Like the asteroid belt, it has also been shaped by a giant planet, although it's more of a thick disk (like a donut) than a thin belt.\nThe Kuiper Belt shouldn't be confused with the Oort Cloud, which is a much more distant region of icy, comet-like bodies that surrounds the solar system, including the Kuiper Belt. Both the Oort Cloud and the Kuiper Belt are thought to be sources of comets.\nThe Kuiper Belt is truly a frontier in space – it's a place we're still just beginning to explore and our understanding is still evolving. Namesake The region is named for astronomer Gerard Kuiper, who published a scientific paper in 1951 that speculated about objects beyond Pluto. Astronomer Kenneth Edgeworth also mentioned objects beyond Pluto in papers he published in the 1940s, and thus it's sometimes referred to as the Edgeworth-Kuiper Belt. Some researchers prefer to call it the Trans-Neptunian Region, and refer to Kuiper Belt objects (KBOs) as trans-Neptunian objects, or TNOs.\nWhatever your preferred term is, the belt occupies an enormous volume in our solar system, and the small worlds that inhabit it have a lot to tell us about early history. These two multiple-exposure images from NASA's Hubble Space Telescope show Kuiper Belt objects, or KBOs",

These missions study planets (Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, etc.), moons, asteroids (Bennu, Psyche, Vesta, etc.), comets, the Sun, and the outer reaches like the Kuiper Belt and Oort Cloud. Human spaceflight, centered around the Artemis program, aims for lunar presence (Lunar Space Station module, prepping for Moon landings with hybrid rocket motors) and potentially Mars. Technological development is crucial, focusing on areas like spacesuits (icy chamber tests), propulsion (hybrid rockets, solar-electric for Psyche), communication (ultralight antennas), power (innovative batteries, Power to Explore Challenge), aircraft technology (thin-wing concepts, X-59 supersonic flight), navigation, and instruments for remote sensing and analysis. Scientific goals span understanding planetary formation (via asteroids like Psyche), searching for life (a key driver, though currently only known on Earth), studying Earth's climate and environment (wildfire data, snowmelt tracking), exploring the universe's origins and composition (Big Bang, dark matter/energy), and ensuring planetary defense (tracking NEOs like 2024 YR4 via CNEOS). The agency utilizes a wide range of tools from ground-based observations to spaceborne telescopes and direct exploration spacecraft, leveraging partnerships (e.g., Boeing, ESA, CSA) and engaging the public and STEM community.",

It delivered the sample to Earth on 13 June 2010.\nHayabusa's close-up observations of the asteroid and the subsequent analysis of its dust in labs on Earth support the conclusion that\n### Context related to: PLATE (Top Chunk Score: 0.789)\n, a process known as “plate tectonics.” Something similar might have happened on Venus early in its history. Today a key element of this process could be operating: subduction, or the sliding of one continental “plate” beneath another, which can also trigger volcanoes. Subduction is believed to be the first step in creating plate tectonics.\nNASA’s Magellan spacecraft, which ended a five-year mission to Venus in 1994, mapped the broiling surface using radar. Magellan saw a land of extreme volcanism – a relatively young surface, one recently reshaped (in geologic terms), and chains of towering mountains. Surface The Soviet Union sent a series of probes to Venus between 1961 and 1984 as part of its Venera program (Venera is Russian for Venus). Ten probes made it to the surface, and a few functioned briefly after landing. The longest survivor lasted two hours; the shortest, 23 minutes. Photos snapped before the landers fried show a barren, dim, and rocky landscape, and a sky that is likely some shade of sulfur yellow.\nVolcanoes and tectonic forces appear to have erased most traces of the early surface of Venus. Newer computer models indicate the resurfacing may have happened piecemeal over an extended period of time. The average age of surface features could be as young as 150 million years, with some older surfaces mixed in.\nVenus has valleys and high mountains dotted with thousands of volcanoes. Its surface features – most named for both real and mythical women – include Ishtar Terra, a rocky, highland area around the size of Australia near the north pole, and an even larger, South-America-sized region called Aphrodite Terra that stretches across the equator. One mountain reaches 36,000 feet (11 kilometers), higher than Mt. Everest.

Center for Near Earth\n's Solar System Dynamics website. Formation Our solar system formed about 4.6 billion years ago from a dense cloud of interstellar gas and dust. The cloud collapsed, possibly due to the shockwave of a nearby exploding star, called a supernova. When this dust cloud collapsed, it formed a solar nebula – a spinning, swirling disk of material.\nAt the center, gravity pulled more and more material in. Eventually, the pressure in the core was so great that hydrogen atoms began to combine and form helium, releasing a tremendous amount of energy. With that, our Sun was born, and it eventually amassed more than 99% of the available matter.\nMatter farther out in the disk was also clumping together. These clumps smashed into one another, forming larger and larger objects. Some of them grew big enough for their gravity to shape them into spheres, becoming planets, dwarf planets, and large moons. In other cases, planets did not form: the asteroid belt is made of bits and pieces of the early solar system that could never quite come together into a planet. Other smaller leftover pieces became asteroids, comets, meteoroids, and small, irregular moons. Structure The order and arrangement of the planets and other bodies in our solar system is due to the way the solar system formed. Nearest to the Sun, only rocky material could withstand the heat when the solar system was young. For this reason, the first four planets – Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars – are terrestrial planets. They are all small with solid, rocky surfaces.\nMeanwhile, materials we are used to seeing as ice, liquid, or gas settled in the outer regions of the young solar system. Gravity pulled these materials together, and that is where we find gas giants Jupiter and Saturn, and the ice giants Uranus and Neptune.

Asteroids Home Facts Exploration Featured Asteroids 2024 YR4 Apophis Psyche Bennu Dinkinesh and Selam Donaldjohanson Didymos and Dimorphos Vesta Eros Ida and Dactyl Itokawa Resources Solar System Home Vesta Overview Vesta is the second most massive body in the main asteroid belt, accounting for almost 9% of the total mass of all asteroids. Only dwarf planet Ceres is more massive in that region of rocky debris between Mars and Jupiter. NASA’s Dawn spacecraft circled Vesta from July 16, 2011, until Sept. 5, 2012, when it departed and began its journey to dwarf planet Ceres.\nThe giant asteroid is almost spherical, and so is nearly classified a dwarf planet. Unlike most known asteroids, Vesta has separated into crust, mantle and core (a characteristic known as being differentiated), much like Earth.\nUnderstanding why this is so was one of the objectives of the Dawn mission. The answer turned out to be that Vesta formed early, within 1 to 2 million years of the birth of the solar system. Short-lived radioactive material that was incorporated into bodies that formed during this epoch heated them to the point where—in cases like Vesta—the objects melted, allowing the dens\n### Context related to: PLANETARY ASTRONOMY (Top Chunk Score: 0.780)\n, and unlike objects seen in our solar system, it may provide new clues into how other solar systems formed.\nUnable to render the provided source\nThe observations suggest this unusual object had been wandering through the Milky Way, unattached to any star system, for hundreds of millions of years before its chance encounter with our star system.\nImmediately after its discovery, telescopes around the world, including ESO’s Very Large Telescope in Chile, were called into action to measure the object’s orbit, brightness and color. Urgency for viewing from ground-based telescopes was vital to get the best data. \nCombining the images from the FORS instrument on the ESO telescope using four different filters with those of other large telescopes, a team of astronomers led by Karen Meech of the Institute for Astronomy in Hawaii found that ‘Oumuamua varies in brightness by a factor of 10 as it spins on its axis every 7.3 hours. No known asteroid or comet from our solar system varies so widely in brightness, with such a large ratio between length and width. The most elongated objects we have seen to date are no more than three times longer than they are wide. The interstellar object ‘Oumuamua is at the center of this image and circled in blue. It is surrounded by the trails of faint stars that are smeared as the telescopes tracked the moving comet.\nESO/K. Meech et al.\n“This unusually big variation in brightness means that the object is highly elongated: about ten times as long as it is wide, with a complex, convoluted shape,” said Meech. “We also found that it had a reddish color, similar to objects in the outer solar system, and confirmed that it is completely inert, without the faintest hint of dust around it.”\nThese properties suggest that ‘Oumuamua is dense,\n### Context related to: NEXT VISIT (Top Chunk Score: 0.780)\nosphere, the enormous bubble of magnetism and ionized gas that the Sun emits. But it will take the spacecraft another 300 years to reach the inner \"edge\" of the Oort cloud and, at its current speed of a million miles a day, some 30,000 years more to finish passing through it.\nOccasionally, some gravitational influence-possibly from a passing star-nudges a comet loose from this incredibly vast and distant depository, and it falls toward the Sun. That is what must have happened to Siding Spring a few million years ago. It has been falling all this time toward the inner solar system, and it's going to give us just one shot at studying it. According to current estimates, its next visit will be in about 740,000 years. Discovery Discovered Jan. 3, 2013 at Siding Spring Observatory, Australia. How This Comet Got Its Name C/ indicates that it is a non-periodic comet. And 2013 A1 indicates that it was the first comet discovered in the first half of January 2013.
