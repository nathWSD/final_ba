        "expected_output": "The first Kuiper Belt Object (KBO) discovered was Pluto in 1930, though it wasn't initially recognized as part of a larger population due to its size and brightness relative to later discoveries and the lack of expectation for such a belt. Gerard Kuiper speculated about objects beyond Pluto in 1951, lending his name to the region (sometimes also called the Edgeworth-Kuiper Belt). Kenneth Edgeworth also mentioned such objects in the 1940s. Significant progress occurred in 1992 when David Jewitt and Jane Luu used a large telescope on Mauna Kea equipped with a CCD camera to discover the second KBO, 1992 QB1 (later named Albion). This technological advancement opened the door to finding thousands more KBOs. The first spacecraft to enter the region was Pioneer 10 in 1983, crossing beyond Neptune's orbit. However, NASA's New Horizons was the first mission to visit a KBO, flying past Pluto and its moons in July 2015. It then performed the most distant flyby in history, visiting the KBO Arrokoth (discovered in 2014 using the Hubble Space Telescope) on January 1, 2019, revealing it to be a contact binary and the most primitive object explored by spacecraft.",
        "retrieval_context": "title: Kuiper Belt Exploration and Discoveries\n text:  David Jewitt and Jane Luu attached a CCD camera to a large (2.2-meter) telescope on Mauna Kea in Hawaii, and they quickly detected an object, which was designated 1992 QB1, and later named Albion. Many more discoveries soon followed, with a couple of thousand KBOs being detected over the next quarter-century.\nThe first spacecraft to enter the Kuiper Belt region was NASA's Pioneer 10 spacecraft when it crossed into the space beyond Neptune's orbit in 1983. But the first spacecraft to visit an object in the Kuiper Belt was New Horizons when it flew by Pluto and its moons. New Horizons then went on to visit Arrokoth.\nTwo moons of the giant planets are thought to potentially be objects originally from the Kuiper Belt that became captured long ago. Neptune's largest moon Triton was visited by NASA's Voyager 2 spacecraft in 1989, while Phoebe, a small outer moon of Saturn, was visited by NASA's Cassini spacecraft in 2004. Both of these potential captured Kuiper Belt objects orbit their planets in a direction opposite of the other moons and the planet's rotation, which is a strong indication that they likely were captured objects that strayed too close to the planets.

        "expected_output": "Based on all the provided text, NASA employs a comprehensive solar system exploration strategy involving robotic and human missions, advanced technology development, and broad scientific inquiry. Robotic missions are central, exemplified by orbiters (Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spotting Curiosity), rovers (Curiosity), telescopes (Hubble, Webb, Roman), sample return missions (OSIRIS-REx to Bennu), and dedicated probes targeting specific bodies (Lucy to Trojan asteroids like Donaldjohanson, Psyche to the metal-rich asteroid). These missions study planets (Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, etc.), moons, asteroids (Bennu, Psyche, Vesta, etc.), comets, the Sun, and the outer reaches like the Kuiper Belt and Oort Cloud. Human spaceflight, centered around the Artemis program, aims for lunar presence (Lunar Space Station module, prepping for Moon landings with hybrid rocket motors) and potentially Mars. Technological development is crucial, focusing on areas like spacesuits (icy chamber tests), propulsion (hybrid rockets, solar-electric for Psyche), communication (ultralight antennas), power (innovative batteries, Power to Explore Challenge), aircraft technology (thin-wing concepts, X-59 supersonic flight), navigation, and instruments for remote sensing and analysis. Scientific goals span understanding planetary formation (via asteroids like Psyche), searching for life (a key driver, though currently only known on Earth), studying Earth's climate and environment (wildfire data, snowmelt tracking), exploring the universe's origins and composition (Big Bang, dark matter/energy), and ensuring planetary defense (tracking NEOs like 2024 YR4 via CNEOS). The agency utilizes a wide range of tools from ground-based observations to spaceborne telescopes and direct exploration spacecraft, leveraging partnerships (e.g., Boeing, ESA, CSA) and engaging the public and STEM community.",
