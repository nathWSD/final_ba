But the first spacecraft to visit an object in the Kuiper Belt was New Horizons when it flew by Pluto and its moons. New Horizons then went on to visit Arrokoth.\n\nTwo moons of the giant planets are thought to potentially be objects originally from the Kuiper Belt that became captured long ago. Neptune's largest moon Triton was visited by NASA's Voyager 2 spacecraft in 1989, while Phoebe, a small outer moon of Saturn, was visited by NASA's Cassini spacecraft in 2004. Both of these potential captured Kuiper Belt objects orbit their planets in a direction opposite of the other moons and the planet's rotation, which is a strong indication that they likely were captured objects that strayed too close to the planets.

The first Kuiper Belt Object –1992 QB1 – was discovered in 1992 by astronomers David Jewitt and Janet Luui.\n\nEuropean Southern Observatory History In 1930, Pluto became the first Kuiper Belt object to be discovered. It would be another 62 years until the second one was known. This had a lot to do with the fact that KBOs are quite far away from Earth and generally quite dark. Pluto has a rather bright, reflective surface, compared to many other KBOs, as well as its large size. These qualities made Pluto easier to detect with the telescopes available in the early 20th century. At the time, scientists had not yet developed ideas about the outer solar system that suggested Pluto might have a lot of company. So, despite its oddly elliptical and tilted orbit, it made sense at the time to think of Pluto as a planet.\n\nThe Kuiper Belt is named for astronomer Gerard Kuiper, who published a scientific paper in 1951 that speculated about objects beyond Pluto. Kuiper's work didn't actually predict the populations of objects we observe in the region named for him, or, crucially, their relationship with Neptune. But he and his ideas were well-known among astronomers such that the general idea of the belt came to be attributed to him. Astronomer Kenneth Edgeworth also briefly mentioned objects beyond Pluto in papers he published in the 1940s, and thus the region is sometimes referred to as the Edgeworth-Kuiper Belt. Other astronomers also speculated that there might be undiscovered icy bodies beyond Neptune, but none were confirmed until 1992.\n\nBy the early 1990s, scientists had access to new tools that were unavailable to Pluto's discoverer, Clyde Tombaugh, in the 1930s. In 1992, astronomers David Jewitt and Jane Luu\n\n### Snippet (LLM Relevance: 0.80, Related to: KUIPER BELT)\n\n*LLM Rationale for this snippet:* This chunk mentions that most of what we know about the Kuiper Belt comes from ground-based telescopes and the Hubble Space Telescope.

It also mentions Gerard Kuiper and Kenneth Edgeworth, key figures associated with the region's discovery and naming.\n\n. Astronomers think there are millions of small, icy objects in this region – including hundreds of thousands that are larger than 60 miles (100 kilometers) wide. Some of the objects, including Pluto, are over 600 miles (1,000 kilometers) wide. In addition to rock and water ice, objects in the Kuiper Belt also contain a variety of other frozen compounds like ammonia and methane.\n\nSimilar to the asteroid belt, the Kuiper Belt is a region of leftovers from the solar system's early history. Like the asteroid belt, it has also been shaped by a giant planet, although it's more of a thick disk (like a donut) than a thin belt.\n\nThe Kuiper Belt shouldn't be confused with the Oort Cloud, which is a much more distant region of icy, comet-like bodies that surrounds the solar system, including the Kuiper Belt. Both the Oort Cloud and the Kuiper Belt are thought to be sources of comets.\n\nThe Kuiper Belt is truly a frontier in space – it's a place we're still just beginning to explore and our understanding is still evolving. Namesake The region is named for astronomer Gerard Kuiper, who published a scientific paper in 1951 that speculated about objects beyond Pluto. Astronomer Kenneth Edgeworth also mentioned objects beyond Pluto in papers he published in the 1940s, and thus it's sometimes referred to as the Edgeworth-Kuiper Belt. Some researchers prefer to call it the Trans-Neptunian Region, and refer to Kuiper Belt objects (KBOs) as trans-Neptunian objects, or TNOs.\n\nWhatever your preferred term is, the belt occupies an enormous volume in our solar system, and the small worlds that inhabit it have a lot to tell us about early history. These two multiple-exposure images from NASA's Hubble Space Telescope show Kuiper Belt objects, or KBOs\n\n### Snippet (LLM Relevance: 0.70, Related to: CENTAUR)\n\n*LLM Rationale for this snippet:* This chunk mentions Pluto's discovery as the first Kuiper Belt object and discusses detached KBOs and Centaurs, providing some historical context and object classification relevant to the query.\n\n as an undiscovered giant planet (in a very distant orbit), the gravity of passing stars, or gravitational perturbations as the Kuiper Belt was forming long ago.\n\nSedna is an example of a detached KBO. The closest it comes to the Sun is 76 AU, while at its farthest it travels out to ~1200 AU. Centaurs Centaurs are objects with orbits that travel through the space between the orbits of Jupiter and Neptune. Objects in these orbits interact strongly with the gravity of the giant planets. Because of these powerful gravitational encounters, most are fated to either be ejected from the solar system or pushed into the inner solar system where they become comets or crash into the Sun and planets.\n\nThis process – the removal of the Centaurs – is ongoing, taking tens of millions of years for the typical Centaur object. Thus, the fact that there are Centaurs around today is evidence that they're being actively supplied from somewhere else. Astronomers think the most likely explanation is that they're relatively recent escapees from the Kuiper Belt. In fact, Centaurs are understood to be scattered objects, like those in the scattered disk – the difference being that the Centaurs have been scattered closer to the Sun by Neptune, rather than farther out. Pluto's Place in the Kuiper Belt In 1930, Pluto became the first Kuiper Belt object to be discovered. It was found at a time before astronomers had reason to expect a large population of icy worlds beyond Neptune. Today it's known as the \"King of the Kuiper Belt\" – and it's the largest object in the region, even though another object similar in size, called Eris, has a slightly higher mass. Pluto’s orbit is said to be in resonance with the orbit of Neptune, meaning Pluto's orbit is in a stable, repeating pattern with Neptune's. For every three orbits completed by Neptune, Pluto makes two orbits.\n\n### Snippet (LLM Relevance: 0.60, Related to: PLUTO)\n\n*LLM Rationale for this snippet:* This chunk mentions the Kuiper Belt as a doughnut-shaped region and mentions the New Horizons spacecraft visiting Pluto and Arrokoth.

Many scattered disk objects have orbits that are tilted by tens of degrees. Some venture hundreds of AU from the Sun and high above the plane of the planets at the farthest point in their orbits, before falling back to a closest point near the orbit of Neptune. The orbits of many objects in the scattered disk are still slowly evolving, with objects here being lost over time, compared to the classical Kuiper Belt, where orbits are more stable.\n\nThe scattered disk gives the donut-shaped classical Kuiper Belt a much wider and thicker extent. Some astronomers talk about the two as separate regions, although their boundaries overlap and are linked together in a number of ways. In particular, the objects in both regions are thought to have ended up there as a result of the migration of Neptune from its original, closer orbit to where it is now. Eris is an example of an object in the scattered disk and is the largest known member of this population. Additional Families Most of the objects in the Kuiper Belt are found in the main part of the belt or in the scattered disk, but there are also a couple of additional families of objects that orbit the Sun interior and exterior to the belt. These additional groups of objects probably came from the Kuiper Belt originally, but have been pulled out of the main regions by the gravity of Neptune or perhaps by another massive planet. Detached Objects Detached Kuiper Belt objects have orbits that never come closer to the Sun than about 40 AU. This sets them apart from most other KBOs, which spend at least part of their orbits in the region between 40 and 50 AU from the Sun. Because their orbits don't come close to Neptune's distance from the Sun (~30 AU), detached objects seem unlikely to have been pulled out of the Kuiper Belt by interactions with the giant planet. Scientists think it's likely some other force is responsible, such as an undiscovered giant planet (\n\n### Snippet (LLM Relevance: 0.60, Related to: NAMESAKE MAKEMAKE)\n\n*LLM Rationale for this snippet:* This chunk mentions Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs), including Pluto, Eris, Haumea, and Makemake, and discusses the New Horizons mission's flyby of Arrokoth. It provides some information about objects studied in the Kuiper Belt, but lacks details on the initial discovery.\n\n Neptune, Pluto makes two orbits. In this situation, Pluto never comes close enough to Neptune to be affected much by its gravity. In fact, even though its orbit crosses Neptune's orbit, Pluto gets physically closer to Uranus than it ever does to Neptune. Kuiper Belt Moons and Binaries A fairly large number of KBOs either have moons – that is, significantly smaller bodies that orbit them – or are binary objects. Binaries are pairs of objects that are relatively similar in size or mass that orbit around a point – a shared center of mass – that lies between them. Some binaries actually touch, creating a sort of peanut shape, creating what's known as a contact binary.\n\nThe small Kuiper Belt Object called Arrokoth is a contact binary. It was discovered in 2014 by NASA’s New Horizons science team, using the Hubble Space Telescope. NASA's New Horizons spacecraft flew by Arrokoth on Jan. 1, 2019, snapping images that showed a double-lobed object that looked like a partially flattened red snowman. Arrokoth is the most distant and the most primitive object ever explored by a spacecraft. NASA's New Horizons spacecraft flew past Arrokoth on New Year's 2019, nearly four years after its historic flight through the Pluto system on July 14, 2015.\n\nDwarf planets Pluto, Eris, Haumea, and Makemake are all Kuiper Belt objects that have moons.\n\nOne thing that makes binary KBOs particularly interesting is that most of them may be extremely ancient, or primordial, objects that have been altered little since their formation. The various ideas for how these pairs form require a lot more objects than the present-day Kuiper Belt appears to contain. One leading idea is that binaries may result from low-speed collisions between KBOs, which would allow them to survive the impact and stick together due to their mutual gravity. Such collisions were likely much more\n\n### Snippet (LLM Relevance: 0.60, Related to: ERODING)\n\n*LLM Rationale for this snippet:* This chunk discusses the Kuiper Belt's relationship to comets and the dynamics of KBO collisions, which provides some context but doesn't directly address the history of discovery or specific spacecraft studies.\n\n. Such collisions were likely much more common billions of years ago when most KBOs were on similar orbits that were more circular and close to the plane of the planets (called the ecliptic). Today such collisions are much rarer. They also tend to be destructive, since lots of KBOs are on now orbits that are tilted or elliptical, meaning they crash into each other with greater force and break apart. Relationship to Comets The Kuiper Belt is a source of comets, but not the only source. Today the Kuiper Belt is thought to be very slowly eroding itself away. Objects there occasionally collide, with the collisional fragments producing smaller KBOs (some of which may become comets), as well as dust that's blown out of the solar system by the solar wind. Pieces produced by colliding KBOs can be pushed by Neptune's gravity into orbits that send them sunward, where Jupiter further corrals them into short loops lasting 20 years or less. These are called short-period Jupiter-family comets. Given their frequent trips into the inner solar system, most tend to exhaust their volatile ices fairly quickly and eventually become dormant, or dead, comets with little or no detectable activity.\n\nResearchers have found that some near-Earth asteroids are actually burned-out comets, and most of them would have started out in the Kuiper Belt. Many comets crash into the Sun or the planets. Those that have close encounters with Jupiter tend to be ripped apart or tossed out of the solar system entirely.\n\nThe other source of comets is the Oort Cloud, where most long-period comets on highly tilted orbits come from.\n\nKeep Exploring Discover More Topics From NASA Sun Planets Asteroids, Comets & Meteors Kuiper Belt National Aeronautics and Space Administration NASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through\n\n### Snippet (LLM Relevance: 0.60, Related to: PALOMAR OBSERVATORY)\n\n*LLM Rationale for this snippet:* This chunk mentions Makemake, a dwarf planet located in the Kuiper Belt, and its discovery, which is relevant to the query.

Unlike many other moons in the solar system, these moons are not tidally locked to Pluto. They all spin and don’t keep the same face towards Pluto.\n\nPluto's moons are named for other mythological figures associated with the underworld. Charon is named for the river Styx boatman who ferries souls in the underworld (as well as honoring Charlene, the wife of discoverer James Christy, who was nicknamed Char). The small moon Nix is named for the goddess of darkness and night, who is also the mother of Charon. Hydra is named for the nine-headed serpent that guards the underworld. Kerberos is named after the three-headed dog of Greek mythology (known as Fluffy in the Harry Potter novels). And Styx is named for the mythological river that separates the world of the living from the realm of the dead. Rings There are no known rings around Pluto. Formation Dwarf planet Pluto is a member of a group of objects that orbit in a disc-like zone beyond the orbit of Neptune called the Kuiper Belt. This distant realm is populated with thousands of miniature icy worlds, which formed early in the history of our solar system about 4.5 billion years ago. These icy, rocky bodies are called Kuiper Belt objects, transneptunian objects, or plutoids. Structure Pluto is about two-thirds the diameter of Earth's Moon and probably has a rocky core surrounded by a mantle of water ice. Interesting ices like methane and nitrogen frost coat the surface. Due to its lower density, Pluto's mass is about one-sixth that of Earth's Moon. Surface Pluto's surface has mountains, valleys, plains, and craters. The temperature on Pluto can be as cold as -375 to -400 degrees Fahrenheit (-226 to -240 degrees Celsius).\n\nPluto\n\n### Snippet (LLM Relevance: 0.50, Related to: KBOS)\n\n*LLM Rationale for this snippet:* This chunk discusses the classification of Kuiper Belt objects and how our understanding of the Kuiper Belt has evolved, which is somewhat relevant to the query about the historical progression of understanding the belt.\n\n the early surprises was that KBOs could be grouped according to the shapes and sizes of their orbits. This led scientists to understand that there are several distinct groupings, or populations, of these objects whose orbits provide clues about their history. Which category an object belongs to has a lot to do with how it has interacted with the gravity of Neptune over time.\n\nMost of the objects in the Kuiper Belt are found in the main part of the belt itself or in the scattered disk: Classical KBOs A large fraction of KBOs orbit the Sun in what's called the classical Kuiper Belt. The term \"classical\" refers to the fact that, among the KBOs, these objects have orbits most similar to the original, or classical, idea of what the Kuiper Belt was expected to be like before astronomers started actually finding objects there. (The expectation was that, if there were objects beyond Neptune, they would be in relatively circular orbits that aren't tilted too much from the plane of the planets. Instead, many KBOs are found to have significantly elliptical and tilted orbits. Thus, to some extent, the classification of KBOs still reflects our evolving understanding of this distant region of the solar system.)\n\nThere are two main groups of objects in the classical Kuiper Belt, referred to as \"cold\" and \"hot.\" These terms don't refer to temperature – instead, they describe the orbits of the objects, along with the amount of influence Neptune's gravity has had on them.\n\nAll classical KBOs have a similar average distance from the Sun between about 40 and 50 AU. Cold classical KBOs have relatively circular orbits that are not tilted much away from the plane of the planets; hot classical KBOs have more elliptical and tilted orbits (which astronomers refer to as eccentric and inclined, respectively). This means the cold variety spend most of their time at about the same distance from the Sun, while the hot ones\n\n### Snippet (LLM Relevance: 0.40, Related to: DISK)\n\n*LLM Rationale for this snippet:* This chunk provides some basic information about the Kuiper Belt's size, distance, and formation, which is tangentially relevant to the query, but lacks specific details about its discovery and exploration history.\n\n Belt objects, or KBOs, against a background of stars in the constellation Sagittarius. The two KBOs are roughly 4 billion miles from Earth.\n\nNASA, ESA, SwRI, JHU/APL, New Horizons KBO Search Team Size and Distance The Kuiper Belt is one of the largest structures in our solar system – others being the Oort Cloud, the heliosphere, and the magnetosphere of Jupiter. Its overall shape is like a puffed-up disk or donut. Its inner edge begins at the orbit of Neptune, at about 30 AU from the Sun. (1 AU, or astronomical unit, is the distance from Earth to the Sun.) The inner, main region of the Kuiper Belt ends around 50 AU from the Sun. Overlapping the outer edge of the main part of the Kuiper Belt is a second region called the scattered disk, which continues outward to nearly 1,000 AU, with some bodies on orbits that go even farther beyond.\n\nSo far, more than 2,000 trans-Neptunian objects have been cataloged by observers, representing only a tiny fraction of the total number of objects scientists think are out there. In fact, astronomers estimate there are hundreds of thousands of objects in the region that are larger than 60 miles (100 kilometers) wide or larger. However, the total mass of all the material in the Kuiper Belt is estimated to be no more than about 10% of the mass of Earth. Formation and Origins Astronomers think the icy objects of the Kuiper Belt are remnants left over from the formation of the solar system. Similar to the relationship between the main asteroid belt and Jupiter, it's a region of objects that might have come together to form a planet had Neptune not been there. Instead, Neptune's gravity stirred up this region of space so much that the small, icy objects there weren't able to coalesce into a large planet.\n\nThe\n\n## Connections Between Identified Themes\n\n- **VESTA** --[instance of]--> **ASTEROID**\n\n- **EUNIKE** --[instance of]--> **ASTEROID**\n\n- **2024 YR4** --[instance of]--> **ASTEROID**\n\n- **DINKINESH** --[instance of]--> **ASTEROID**\n\n- **PLANET** --[instance of]--> **URANUS**",

The comet was thought to have been orbiting Jupiter for about a decade before its demise.\n\nThe disruption of a comet into multiple fragments was rare, and observing a captured comet in orbit about Jupiter was even more unusual, but the biggest and rarest revelation was that the fragments were going to smash into Jupiter.\n\nNASA had spacecraft in position to watch – for the first time in history – a collision between two bodies in the solar system. NASA's Galileo orbiter (then still en route to Jupiter) captured unprecedented direct views as the string of fragments labeled A through W smashed into Jupiter's cloud tops. The impacts started on July 16, 1994, and ended on July 22, 1994. These images of Jupiter show the luminous night-side impact of fragment W of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9. The images were taken by the Galileo spacecraft on July 22, 1994. \n\nNASA/JPL-Caltech/Galileo Imaging Team\n\nMany Earth-based observatories and orbiting spacecraft including Hubble Space Telescope, Ulysses, and Voyager 2 also studied the impact and its aftermath.\n\nThe \"freight train\" of fragments smashed into Jupiter with the force of 300 million atomic bombs. The fragments created huge plumes that were 1,200 to 1,900 miles (2,000 to 3,000 kilometers) high and heated the atmosphere to temperatures as hot as 53,000 to 71,000 degrees Fahrenheit (30,000 to 40,000 degrees Celsius). Shoemaker-Levy 9 left dark, ringed scars that were eventually erased by Jupiter's winds.\n\nWhile the impact was dramatic, it was more than a show. It gave scientists an opportunity to gain new insights into Jupiter, Shoemaker-Levy 9, and cosmic collisions in general.

Paul Wild discovered this comet during its first revolution of the Sun on the new orbit.\n\nSince Wild 2 is a fresh comet (it has not had as many orbits around the Sun at close quarters) it is an ideal specimen for discovering more about the early solar system.\n\nNASA made use of this special comet, when in 2004 it sent the Stardust mission to fly by it and gather particles—the first such gathering of extraterrestrial materials from beyond the orbit of the moon. These samples were gathered in an aerogel collector as the spacecraft flew within 236 kilometers (147 miles) of the comet. The samples were then returned to Earth in an Apollo-like capsule in 2006. In those samples, scientists discovered glycine: a fundamental building block of life. How This Comet Got Its Name Comets are usually named for their discoverer(s) or for the name of the observatory/telescope used in the discovery.

It provides insight into a specific type of NASA mission and its technological focus, contributing to understanding NASA's overall approach.\n\n Dimorphos on Sept. 26, 2022, astronomers used telescopes on Earth to measure how much that time had changed. The investigation team confirmed the spacecraft’s impact altered Dimorphos’ orbit around Didymos by 32 minutes, shortening the 11-hour and 55-minute orbit to 11 hours and 23 minutes. (This measurement has a margin of uncertainty of approximately plus or minus 2 minutes.)\n\nBefore its encounter, NASA had defined a minimum successful orbit period change of Dimorphos as a change of 73 seconds or more. The early data showed DART surpassed this minimum benchmark by more than 25 times.\n\n“This result is one important step toward understanding the full effect of DART’s impact with its target asteroid,” said Lori Glaze, director of NASA’s Planetary Science Division at NASA Headquarters in Washington. “As new data come in each day, astronomers will be able to better assess whether, and how, a mission like DART could be used in the future to help protect Earth from a collision with an asteroid if we ever discover one headed our way.”\n\nThe investigation team is still acquiring data from ground-based observatories around the world – as well as with radar facilities at NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory’s Goldstone planetary radar in California and the National Science Foundation’s Green Bank Observatory in West Virginia. They are updating the period measurement with frequent observations to improve its precision.\n\nThe images of DART’s impact were streamed live back to Earth as the spacecraft plunged into Dimorphos. The camera was DART’s only onboard instrument. Called DRACO (Didymos Reconnaissance and Asteroid Camera for Optical navigation), the high-resolution imager was based on the New Horizons spacecraft’s LORRI instrument. Before impact, DRACO helped DART navigate to the Didymos system.\n\nDART also had a passenger – a small spacecraft\n\n### Snippet (LLM Relevance: 0.40, Related to: MISSION JOIN US)\n\n*LLM Rationale for this snippet:* This chunk mentions NASA's Pioneer 10 and New Horizons missions, which are relevant to solar system exploration, but lacks detail on the overall approach or specific goals beyond visiting specific objects.\n\n David Jewitt and Jane Luu attached a CCD camera to a large (2.2-meter) telescope on Mauna Kea in Hawaii, and they quickly detected an object, which was designated 1992 QB1, and later named Albion. Many more discoveries soon followed, with a couple of thousand KBOs being detected over the next quarter-century.\n\nThe first spacecraft to enter the Kuiper Belt region was NASA's Pioneer 10 spacecraft when it crossed into the space beyond Neptune's orbit in 1983. But the first spacecraft to visit an object in the Kuiper Belt was New Horizons when it flew by Pluto and its moons. New Horizons then went on to visit Arrokoth.\n\nTwo moons of the giant planets are thought to potentially be objects originally from the Kuiper Belt that became captured long ago. Neptune's largest moon Triton was visited by NASA's Voyager 2 spacecraft in 1989, while Phoebe, a small outer moon of Saturn, was visited by NASA's Cassini spacecraft in 2004. Both of these potential captured Kuiper Belt objects orbit their planets in a direction opposite of the other moons and the planet's rotation, which is a strong indication that they likely were captured objects that strayed too close to the planets.

Scientists theorized Jupiter was a mostly homogeneous mix of hydrogen and helium gases, surrounding a small, solid core of heavier elements – ice, rock, and metal formed from debris and small objects swirling around that area of the embryonic solar system 4 billion years ago.\n\nNASA’s Juno spacecraft, measuring Jupiter’s gravity and magnetic field, found data suggesting the core is much larger than expected, and not solid. Instead, it’s partially dissolved, with no clear separation from the metallic hydrogen around it, leading researchers to describe the core as dilute, or “fuzzy.” Surface As a gas giant, Jupiter doesn’t have a true surface. The planet is mostly swirling gases and liquids. While a spacecraft would have nowhere to land on Jupiter, it wouldn’t be able to fly through unscathed either. The extreme pressures and temperatures deep inside the planet crush, melt, and vaporize spacecraft trying to fly into the planet. Atmosphere Jupiter's appearance is a tapestry of colorful stripes and spots – the cloud bands that encircle the planet, and the cyclonic storms dotting it from pole to pole. The gas planet likely has three distinct cloud layers in its \"skies\" that, taken together, span about 44 miles (71 kilometers). The top cloud is probably made of ammonia ice, while the middle layer is likely made of ammonium hydrosulfide crystals. The innermost layer may be made of water ice and vapor.\n\nThe vivid colors you see in thick bands across Jupiter may be plumes of sulfur and phosphorus-containing gases rising from the planet's warmer interior. Jupiter's fast rotation – spinning once every 10 hours – creates strong jet streams, separating its clouds into dark belts and bright zones across long stretches.\n\nWith no solid surface to slow them down, Jupiter's spots can persist for\n\n### Snippet (LLM Relevance: 0.40, Related to: FORMATION)\n\n*LLM Rationale for this snippet:* This chunk describes the Didymos asteroid system and the DART mission, which provides some insight into NASA's planetary defense efforts and asteroid exploration, but it doesn't offer a comprehensive overview of NASA's broader solar system exploration strategy.\n\n half the long axis of their orbital ellipse, referred to as the semi-major axis, is between 1 AU and 1.3 AU [that is, interior to Mars’ orbit].)\n\nDidymos spins rapidly – rotating about once every 2.26 hours. The DART investigation team confirmed the spacecraft’s Sept. 26, 2022, impact altered Dimorphos’ orbit around Didymos by 32 minutes, shortening the 11-hour and 55-minute orbit to 11 hours and 23 minutes. This measurement has a margin of uncertainty of approximately plus or minus 2 minutes. Structure Didymos is shaped like a spinning top with a raised ridge running along its equator – a shape that’s common among binary asteroids. It’s thought that the asteroid’s rapid spin drives material toward the equator causing a bulge in the middle.\n\nBefore DART, not much was known about the structure of Dimorphos. Scientists are studying data from the spacecraft to learn more about both asteroids. Formation Whether binary asteroids all form the same way or by many different processes isn’t yet known. The rapid spin of Didymos suggests that the moonlet may have been formed through a process called rotational fission, in which material is shed from the asteroid due to its fast rotation. Didymos is thought to have started spinning faster because infrared light was emitted unevenly from its Sun-warmed surface, resulting in a twisting force, or torque. Over millions of years, this process could have built up enough momentum to release material from the surface, which then gathered into the moonlet. But other possibilities haven’t been conclusively ruled out. Surface As the data and images from DART are studied in the coming months, scientists will be able to tell us more about the surfaces of Didymos and Dimorphos. Before DART, scientists thought they might have surfaces similar to asteroids that have been visited\n\n### Snippet (LLM Relevance: 0.40, Related to: EROS)\n\n*LLM Rationale for this snippet:* This chunk describes the Psyche mission, including its target, scientific goals (understanding planetesimal cores), and technological approach (solar-electric propulsion).

The asteroid is most likely a survivor of multiple violent hit-and-run collisions, common when the solar system was forming. Thus, Psyche may be able to tell us how Earth’s core and the cores of the other rocky, or terrestrial, planets came to be.\n\nPsyche orbits the Sun between Mars and Jupiter at a distance ranging from 235 million to 309 million miles (378 million to 497 million kilometers) from the Sun. That’s 2.5 to 3.3 Astronomical Units (AU), with 1 AU being the distance between Earth and the Sun.

The Psyche spacecraft will launch in October 2023 and travel to the asteroid using solar-electric (low-thrust) propulsion, following a Mars flyby and a gravity assist.\n\nOnce in orbit, the spacecraft will map and study Psyche using a multispectral imager, a gamma-ray and neutron spectrometer, a magnetometer, and a radio instrument (for gravity measurement). The mission’s goal is, among other things, to determine whether Psyche is indeed the core of a planetesimal.
