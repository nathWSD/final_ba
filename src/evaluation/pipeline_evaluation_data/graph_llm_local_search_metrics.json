If it were sliced in half horizontally at the equator – picture a squished oval – it would measure 173 miles (280 kilometers) across at its widest point and 144 miles (232 kilometers) long. Its surface area is 64,000 square miles (165,800 square kilometers).\nUp until recently, the scientific consensus was that the asteroid Psyche consisted mostly of metal. The more recent data indicates that the asteroid is possibly a mix of metal and silicate, the same material found in glass and sand. The best analysis indicates that Psyche is likely made of a mixture of rock and metal, with metal composing 30% to 60% of its volume. The asteroid’s composition has been determined by radar observations and by the measurements of the asteroid’s thermal inertia (how quickly an object gains or re-radiates heat).\nBy combining radar and optical observations, scientists generated a 3D model of Psyche that shows evidence of two craterlike depressions. It suggests that there is significant variation in the metal content and color of the asteroid over its surface. But until NASA's Psyche mission sees the asteroid Psyche up close for the first time, we will not know what it actually looks like.\nUnable to render the provided source\nScientists think Psyche may consist of significant amounts of metal from the core of a planetes\n\n## From: Solar_System\n was the 16th asteroid to be discovered, it is sometimes referred to as 16 Psyche.

The asteroid is most likely a survivor of multiple violent hit-and-run collisions, common when the solar system was forming. Thus, Psyche may be able to tell us how Earth’s core and the cores of the other rocky, or terrestrial, planets came to be.\nPsyche orbits the Sun between Mars and Jupiter at a distance ranging from 235 million to 309 million miles (378 million to 497 million kilometers) from the Sun. That’s 2.5 to 3.3 Astronomical Units (AU), with 1 AU being the distance between Earth and the Sun. Psyche takes about five Earth years to complete one orbit of the Sun, but it takes just over four hours to rotate once on its axis (a Psyche “day”). Exploration An artist's concept of the Psyche spacecraft.\nMaxar/ASU/P. Rubin/NASA/JPL-Caltech\nThis intriguing asteroid is now the primary target of NASA's Psyche mission. The Psyche spacecraft will launch in October 2023 and travel to the asteroid using solar-electric (low-thrust) propulsion, following a Mars flyby and a gravity assist.\nOnce in orbit, the spacecraft will map and study Psyche using a multispectral imager, a gamma-ray and neutron spectrometer, a magnetometer, and a radio instrument (for gravity measurement). The mission’s goal is, among other things, to determine whether Psyche is indeed the core of a planetesimal. How Psyche Got its Name Psyche was discovered by Italian astronomer Annibale de Gasparis on March 17, 1852. He named the asteroid for Psyche, the Greek goddess of the soul who was born mortal and married Eros (Roman Cupid), the god of Love.\nBecause it was the 16th asteroid to be\n\n## From: Solar_System\n the Moon article 5 days ago 3 min read Help Classify Galaxies Seen by NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope! article 6 days ago 1 min read 27 Key Images in Hubble History article 7 days ago Highlights 4 min read El X-59 de la NASA completa las pruebas electromagnéticas article 2 months ago 1 min read Mejores imágenes de Ciencia en la estación espacial 2024 article 3 months ago 11 min read La NASA identifica causa de pérdida de material del escudo térmico de Orion de Artemis I article 5 months ago Explore This Section\n  1. … 2.

Asteroids Home Facts Exploration Featured Asteroids 2024 YR4 Apophis Psyche Bennu Dinkinesh and Selam Donaldjohanson Didymos and Dimorphos Vesta Eros Ida and Dactyl Itokawa Resources Solar System Home Vesta Overview Vesta is the second most massive body in the main asteroid belt, accounting for almost 9% of the total mass of all asteroids. Only dwarf planet Ceres is more massive in that region of rocky debris between Mars and Jupiter. NASA’s Dawn spacecraft circled Vesta from July 16, 2011, until Sept. 5, 2012, when it departed and began its journey to dwarf planet Ceres.\nThe giant asteroid is almost spherical, and so is nearly classified a dwarf planet. Unlike most known asteroids, Vesta has separated into crust, mantle and core (a characteristic known as being differentiated), much like Earth.\nUnderstanding why this is so was one of the objectives of the Dawn mission. The answer turned out to be that Vesta formed early, within 1 to 2 million years of the birth of the solar system. Short-lived radioactive material that was incorporated into bodies that formed during this epoch heated them to the point where—in cases like Vesta—the objects melted, allowing the dens\n\n## From: Solar_System\nthe objects melted, allowing the denser materials to sink to the asteroid's core and the lower density materials to rise.\nUnable to render the provided source\nVesta has one of the largest brightness ranges observed on any rocky body in our solar system. The bright materials appear to be native rocks, while the dark material is believed to have been deposited by other asteroids crashing into Vesta. Scientists on the Dawn team estimate that about 300 dark asteroids with diameters ranging from one to 10 km (0.6 to six miles) hit Vesta during the last 3.5 billion years. This would have been enough to wrap the Vesta in a blanket of material about three to seven feet (one to two meters) thick.\nAn extensive system of troughs encircles Vesta's equatorial region. The largest, named Divalia Fossa, is bigger than the Grand Canyon.\nVesta appears to be the source of the Howardite, Eucrite and Diogenite groups of meteorites that have been found on Earth. They help scientists understand the \"Lunar Cataclysm,\" when a repositioning of the gas-giant planets billions of years ago destabilized the orbits of asteroids in the early asteroid belt and triggered a solar-system-wide bombardment. They also provide clues to Vesta's geochemical evolution, a story that was tested and enhanced by the information Dawn provided about the asteroid's surface and interior.\nVesta is believed to have lost about one percent of its mass less than a billion years ago in a massive collision responsible for the Rheasilvia crater, which is about 310 miles (500 kilometers) wide—some 95 percent of the asteroid's mean diameter. The Vesta family of asteroids is probably debris from this collision. Another huge crater is Veneneia, which is about 250 miles (400 km) in diameter. Discovery Vesta was discovered at Bremen, Germany, on Mar. 29, 1807\n\n## From: Solar_System\nokawa Resources Solar System Home Asteroids Introduction Asteroids, sometimes called minor planets, are rocky, airless remnants left over from the early formation of our solar system about 4.6 billion years ago.\nMost asteroids can be found orbiting the Sun between Mars and Jupiter within the main asteroid belt. Asteroids range in size from Vesta – the largest at about 329 miles (530 kilometers) in diameter – to bodies that are less than 33 feet (10 meters) across. The total mass of all the asteroids combined is less than that of Earth's Moon. What if We Discovered an Asteroid Headed for Earth?

Center for Near Earth\n\n## From: Solar_System\n labs on Earth support the conclusion that Itokawa is part of what remains from a much larger object that was shattered by a collision. The dust also confirms that S-type (this refers to the asteroid's color spectrum) asteroids like Itokawa, which are the most common type of asteroid in the inner main belt, are the source of the most common kind of meteorite found on Earth: the ordinary chondrite.\nUnable to render the provided source\nScientists think Itokawa is not solid, but rather is a rubble pile, an agglomeration of rocks loosely held together by their mutual gravity. Few craters are visible, presumably because any impact energetic enough to create a crater shakes rocks loose and they fill the hole.\nOne sign that the asteroid was once part of a much larger object is that many of the captured dust particles show signs of having slowly cooled after forming deep inside a rocky object at a temperature of some 1,500 degrees Fahrenheit (800 degrees Celsius). For this to have occurred, the diameter of the rocky object would have to have been greater than 20 km (12 miles), whereas Itokawa's longest dimension is only 0.5 km (0.3 miles).\nAnother clue is that the largest boulder found on Itokawa is about 50 m (160 feet) across, which is believed to be too big to have been ejected by the impact that created the asteroid's largest crater. Scientists think the rock is a fragment of whatever cataclysmic event resulted in Itokawa's current construction.\nWriting in the journal Science, Hayabusa's science team described the asteroid's shape as resembling a sea otter, with one distinct part designated as the head and the other, larger part designated as the body. One of the scenarios that the team cited as most likely to explain this is that after Itokawa's parent body was shattered, the slight mutual gravity of the fragments brought them together into two or more rubble piles, and\n\n# Key Entities (LLM Graph)\n\n## PSYCHE (ASTEROID)\nA featured asteroid mentioned in the text.\n\n## ROCK (ROCK)\nA material that, mixed with metal, likely forms the composition of the asteroid Psyche.\n\n## METAL (MATERIAL)\nA key material believed to constitute a significant portion (30% to 60% by volume) of the asteroid Psyche.\n\n## GAS AND DUST (INSTRUMENT)\nAn instrument aboard the Psyche Spacecraft that will be used to map and study Psyche Asteroid.\n\n## NASA'S GOLDSTONE SOLAR SYSTEM RADAR (TECHNOLOGY)\nObservational technology used to determine Psyche's composition and, combined with optical observations, to help generate 3D models of the asteroid.\n\n## MAGNETOMETER (INSTRUMENT)\nAn instrument aboard the Psyche Spacecraft that will be used to map and study Psyche Asteroid.\n\n## PSYCHE ASTEROID (ASTEROID)\nAn asteroid, likely the core of a planetesimal and a survivor of early solar system collisions.

Bennu coalesced from a small portion of the leftover rubble about 1 to 2 billion years ago. It may have formed in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, and drifted close to Earth since then.

It's a typical member of the Amors group of NEAs, which cross Mars' orbit but do not quite reach that of Earth. Unlike the much more numerous main-belt asteroids between Mars and Jupiter, NEAs are thought to be dead comets or fragments from main-belt asteroid collisions.\nEros was observed with ground-based telescopes for a century before our spacecraft gave us a close-up look, and was the subject of a worldwide observation campaign during its close approach to Earth in 1975 when it was only 14 million miles (22 million kilometers) away. Discovery 433 Eros was discovered on Aug. 13, 1898, by Gustav Witt, director of the Urania Observatory in Berlin, and independently on the same day by Auguste H.P. Charlois at Nice, France.\nWitt's discovery was the accidental byproduct of a two-hour photographic exposure he conducted of a different asteroid: 185 Eunike. Along with Eunike, the image he produced showed a 0.4-mm image trail, and observations on the following evening identified the object as one of unusually high apparent motion on the sky. Less than two weeks later, Adolf J. Berberich computed that the object's orbit brought it well inside the orbit of Mars, making it the first-known near-Earth asteroid.

But Eros was important to astronomers as far back as 1898 when it became the first near-Earth asteroid (NEA) to be discovered.\nThe NEAR spacecraft first flew by Eros on Dec. 23, 1998, at a distance of about 2,400 miles (about 3,800 kilometers) and found that the asteroid was smaller than expected and had two medium-sized craters, a long surface ridge, and a density similar to that of Earth's crust. After several trajectory adjustments, NEAR finally moved into orbit around Eros on Valentine's Day (befitting an asteroid named for the Greek god of love), Feb. 14, 2000.\nAfter nearly a year in orbit, during which time the spacecraft was renamed \"NEAR Shoemaker\" in honor of astrogeology pioneer Eugene Shoemaker, the mission carried out humanity's first asteroid landing on Feb. 12, 2001. Eros was 196 million miles (315 million kilometers) from Earth at the time.\nThe spacecraft wasn't expected to survive the landing but its instruments remained operational, leading to yet another milestone. \"This is the first gamma-ray experiment that has ever been done on the surface of a body other than Earth,\" said Dr. Jacob Trombka of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. \"In fact, we can say it's the first feasibility study of how to design an instrument to be used on a rover that could select samples from the surface, look for the presence of water, or map the surface for the purpose of future mining.\"\nThe spacecraft issued its final transmission\n\n## From: Solar_System\n visitor from a faraway star system, shaped like nothing we’ve ever seen in our own solar system neighborhood.” Discovery The first known interstellar object to visit our solar system, 1I/2017 U1 ‘Oumuamua, was discovered Oct. 19, 2017 by the University of Hawaii’s Pan-STARRS1 telescope, funded by NASA’s Near-Earth Object Observations (NEOO) Program, which finds and tracks asteroids and comets in Earth’s neighborhood. While originally classified as a comet, observations revealed no signs of cometary activity after it slingshotted past the Sun on Sept. 9, 2017 at a blistering speed of 196,000 miles per hour (87.3 kilometers per second). It was briefly classified as an asteroid until new measurements found it was accelerating slightly, a sign it behaves more like a comet. How 'Oumuamua Got its Name The object was officially named 1I/2017 U1 by the International Astronomical Union (IAU), which is responsible for granting official names to bodies in the solar system and beyond. In addition to the technical name, the Pan-STARRS team dubbed it ‘Oumuamua (pronounced oh MOO-uh MOO-uh), which is Hawaiian for “a messenger from afar arriving first.” Learn More Planetary Defense NASA's Planetary Defense Coordination Office (PDCO) manages the agency's ongoing mission of finding, tracking, and better understanding asteroids and comets that could pose an impact hazard to Earth.

A little more than five months later, scientists studying the images Galileo sent back to Earth noticed that a tiny moon accompanied the asteroid.\n\"It was previously thought that natural satellites of asteroids could form, but they probably weren't common,\" said Torrence Johnson, Galileo's project scientist. \"Having found one fairly quickly, we can say that they're probably more common than previously thought.\"\nUnable to render the provided source\nLocated in the main belt between Mars and Jupiter, Ida is one of the Koronis family of asteroids, which are thought to be the debris of an ancient collision between two larger objects. It is covered in craters and a deep layer of regolith (pulverized rock).\n\"Ida's age is baffling because the craters visible on its surface suggest that it is old, but being a part of the Koronis family suggests it is younger,\" Johnson said.\nIda is an S-type asteroid, composed mainly of silicate rock. This type of asteroid dominates the inner region of the asteroid belt, but comprises only about 17 percent of all known asteroids. Discovery 243 Ida was discovered Sept. 29, 1884, by Austrian astronomer Johann Palisa at the Vienna Observatory. Its moon, Dactyl, was discovered on Feb. 17, 1994, by Ann Harch of the Galileo imaging team. How Ida Got Its Name Ida was named by Moriz von Kuffner, a Viennese brewer and amateur astronomer, after a nymph in Greek mythology who was entrusted to care for the infant Zeus together with her sister Adrasteia. The International Astronomical Union named Dactyl for mythological creatures that lived on Mt. Ida on the island of Crete.\nKeep Exploring Discover More Topics From NASA Sun Planets Asteroids, Comets & Meteors K\n\n# Key Entities (LLM Graph)\n\n## APOPHIS (ASTEROID)\nA featured asteroid mentioned in the text.\n\n## FABRIZIO BERNARDI (PERSON)\nAn astronomer who co-discovered asteroid Apophis in 2004.\n\n## DAVID THOLEN (PERSON)\nAn astronomer who co-discovered asteroid Apophis in 2004.\n\n## KITT PEAK NATIONAL OBSERVATORY (FACILITY)\nThe observatory in Tucson, Arizona, where asteroid Apophis was discovered in 2004.\n\n## ASTRONOMERS (PERSON)\nScientists who closely tracked the asteroid Apophis after its discovery.\n\n## ROY TUCKER (PERSON)\nAn astronomer who co-discovered asteroid Apophis in 2004.\n\n## GBO (ORGANIZATION)\nGreen Bank Observatory, credited for images of asteroid Apophis and operator of the Green Bank Telescope.\n\n## AUI (ORGANIZATION)\nAssociated Universities, Inc., credited for images of asteroid Apophis.\n\n# Key Relationships (LLM Graph)\n\n- KITT PEAK NATIONAL OBSERVATORY → Kitt Peak National Observatory is located in Tucson, Arizona. → TUCSON, ARIZONA (strength: 0.7)\n- KITT PEAK NATIONAL OBSERVATORY → The Urania Observatory, where Witt discovered Eros, is located in Berlin. → BERLIN (strength: 1.0)\n- FABRIZIO BERNARDI → Fabrizio Bernardi was one of the astronomers who discovered Apophis on June 19, 2004. → APOPHIS (strength: 1.0)\n- AUI → Associated Universities, Inc.

The bright materials appear to be native rocks, while the dark material is believed to have been deposited by other asteroids crashing into Vesta. Scientists on the Dawn team estimate that about 300 dark asteroids with diameters ranging from one to 10 km (0.6 to six miles) hit Vesta during the last 3.5 billion years. This would have been enough to wrap the Vesta in a blanket of material about three to seven feet (one to two meters) thick.\nAn extensive system of troughs encircles Vesta's equatorial region. The largest, named Divalia Fossa, is bigger than the Grand Canyon.\nVesta appears to be the source of the Howardite, Eucrite and Diogenite groups of meteorites that have been found on Earth. They help scientists understand the \"Lunar Cataclysm,\" when a repositioning of the gas-giant planets billions of years ago destabilized the orbits of asteroids in the early asteroid belt and triggered a solar-system-wide bombardment. They also provide clues to Vesta's geochemical evolution, a story that was tested and enhanced by the information Dawn provided about the asteroid's surface and interior.\nVesta is believed to have lost about one percent of its mass less than a billion years ago in a massive collision responsible for the Rheasilvia crater, which is about 310 miles (500 kilometers) wide—some 95 percent of the asteroid's mean diameter. The Vesta family of asteroids is probably debris from this collision. Another huge crater is Veneneia, which is about 250 miles (400 km) in diameter.

Only dwarf planet Ceres is more massive in that region of rocky debris between Mars and Jupiter. NASA’s Dawn spacecraft circled Vesta from July 16, 2011, until Sept. 5, 2012, when it departed and began its journey to dwarf planet Ceres.\nThe giant asteroid is almost spherical, and so is nearly classified a dwarf planet. Unlike most known asteroids, Vesta has separated into crust, mantle and core (a characteristic known as being differentiated), much like Earth.\nUnderstanding why this is so was one of the objectives of the Dawn mission. The answer turned out to be that Vesta formed early, within 1 to 2 million years of the birth of the solar system. Short-lived radioactive material that was incorporated into bodies that formed during this epoch heated them to the point where—in cases like Vesta—the objects melted, allowing the dens\n\n## From: Solar_System\n on Mar. 29, 1807 by Heinrich Wilhelm Olbers, who had previously discovered Pallas. He proposed—incorrectly as it turned out—that Ceres and Pallas were fragments of a destroyed planet, and found Vesta as he searched for more such objects. Vesta was the fourth asteroid ever to be discovered. How Vesta Got Its Name 4 Vesta’s discoverer, Heinrich Wilhelm Olbers, gave the honor of naming the new asteroid to German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss, who had computed its orbit. Gauss named it Vesta after the goddess of the hearth and household in Roman mythology.\nKeep Exploring Discover More Topics From NASA Sun Planets Asteroids, Comets & Meteors Kuiper Belt National Aeronautics and Space Administration NASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery.\n  * About NASA's Mission Join Us * Home * News & Events * Multimedia * NASA+ * Missions * Humans in Space * Earth * The Solar System * The Universe * Science * Aeronautics * Technology * Learning Resources * About NASA * NASA en Español Follow NASA More NASA Social Accounts NASA Newsletters Sitemap For Media Privacy Policy FOIA No FEAR Act Office of the IG Budget & Annual Reports Agency Financial Reports Contact NASA Accessibility Page Last Updated: \nApr 23, 2025 Page Editor: \nAMANDA BARNETT Responsible NASA Official for Science: \nDana Bolles\n\n* Explore Search * News & Events ### News & Events * Recently Published * Video Series on NASA+ * Podcasts * Blogs * Newsletters * Social Media * Media Resources * Multimedia ### Multimedia * Images * Videos on NASA+ * Sounds and Ringtones * Interactives * NASA Apps * Podcasts * e-Books * STEM Multimedia * NASA+ Search Suggested Searches Climate Change Artemis\n\n## From: Solar_System\n This Section\n  1. … 2.

If it were sliced in half horizontally at the equator – picture a squished oval – it would measure 173 miles (280 kilometers) across at its widest point and 144 miles (232 kilometers) long. Its surface area is 64,000 square miles (165,800 square kilometers).\nUp until recently, the scientific consensus was that the asteroid Psyche consisted mostly of metal. The more recent data indicates that the asteroid is possibly a mix of metal and silicate, the same material found in glass and sand. The best analysis indicates that Psyche is likely made of a mixture of rock and metal, with metal composing 30% to 60% of its volume. The asteroid’s composition has been determined by radar observations and by the measurements of the asteroid’s thermal inertia (how quickly an object gains or re-radiates heat).\nBy combining radar and optical observations, scientists generated a 3D model of Psyche that shows evidence of two craterlike depressions. It suggests that there is significant variation in the metal content and color of the asteroid over its surface. But until NASA's Psyche mission sees the asteroid Psyche up close for the first time, we will not know what it actually looks like.\nUnable to render the provided source\nScientists think Psyche may consist of significant amounts of metal from the core of a planetes\n\n## From: Solar_System\nokawa Resources Solar System Home Asteroids Introduction Asteroids, sometimes called minor planets, are rocky, airless remnants left over from the early formation of our solar system about 4.6 billion years ago.\nMost asteroids can be found orbiting the Sun between Mars and Jupiter within the main asteroid belt. Asteroids range in size from Vesta – the largest at about 329 miles (530 kilometers) in diameter – to bodies that are less than 33 feet (10 meters) across. The total mass of all the asteroids combined is less than that of Earth's Moon. What if We Discovered an Asteroid Headed for Earth?

The dust also confirms that S-type (this refers to the asteroid's color spectrum) asteroids like Itokawa, which are the most common type of asteroid in the inner main belt, are the source of the most common kind of meteorite found on Earth: the ordinary chondrite.\nUnable to render the provided source\nScientists think Itokawa is not solid, but rather is a rubble pile, an agglomeration of rocks loosely held together by their mutual gravity. Few craters are visible, presumably because any impact energetic enough to create a crater shakes rocks loose and they fill the hole.\nOne sign that the asteroid was once part of a much larger object is that many of the captured dust particles show signs of having slowly cooled after forming deep inside a rocky object at a temperature of some 1,500 degrees Fahrenheit (800 degrees Celsius). For this to have occurred, the diameter of the rocky object would have to have been greater than 20 km (12 miles), whereas Itokawa's longest dimension is only 0.5 km (0.3 miles).\nAnother clue is that the largest boulder found on Itokawa is about 50 m (160 feet) across, which is believed to be too big to have been ejected by the impact that created the asteroid's largest crater. Scientists think the rock is a fragment of whatever cataclysmic event resulted in Itokawa's current construction.\nWriting in the journal Science, Hayabusa's science team described the asteroid's shape as resembling a sea otter, with one distinct part designated as the head and the other, larger part designated as the body. One of the scenarios that the team cited as most likely to explain this is that after Itokawa's parent body was shattered, the slight mutual gravity of the fragments brought them together into two or more rubble piles, and\n\n## From: Solar_System\n planet pass in front of a star.

These icy, rocky bodies are called Kuiper Belt objects, transneptunian objects, or plutoids. Structure Astronomers believe Haumea is made of rock with a coating of ice.

A little more than five months later, scientists studying the images Galileo sent back to Earth noticed that a tiny moon accompanied the asteroid.\n\"It was previously thought that natural satellites of asteroids could form, but they probably weren't common,\" said Torrence Johnson, Galileo's project scientist. \"Having found one fairly quickly, we can say that they're probably more common than previously thought.\"\nUnable to render the provided source\nLocated in the main belt between Mars and Jupiter, Ida is one of the Koronis family of asteroids, which are thought to be the debris of an ancient collision between two larger objects. It is covered in craters and a deep layer of regolith (pulverized rock).\n\"Ida's age is baffling because the craters visible on its surface suggest that it is old, but being a part of the Koronis family suggests it is younger,\" Johnson said.\nIda is an S-type asteroid, composed mainly of silicate rock. This type of asteroid dominates the inner region of the asteroid belt, but comprises only about 17 percent of all known asteroids. Discovery 243 Ida was discovered Sept. 29, 1884, by Austrian astronomer Johann Palisa at the Vienna Observatory. Its moon, Dactyl, was discovered on Feb. 17, 1994, by Ann Harch of the Galileo imaging team. How Ida Got Its Name Ida was named by Moriz von Kuffner, a Viennese brewer and amateur astronomer, after a nymph in Greek mythology who was entrusted to care for the infant Zeus together with her sister Adrasteia. The International Astronomical Union named Dactyl for mythological creatures that lived on Mt.

Only dwarf planet Ceres is more massive in that region of rocky debris between Mars and Jupiter. NASA’s Dawn spacecraft circled Vesta from July 16, 2011, until Sept. 5, 2012, when it departed and began its journey to dwarf planet Ceres.\nThe giant asteroid is almost spherical, and so is nearly classified a dwarf planet. Unlike most known asteroids, Vesta has separated into crust, mantle and core (a characteristic known as being differentiated), much like Earth.\nUnderstanding why this is so was one of the objectives of the Dawn mission. The answer turned out to be that Vesta formed early, within 1 to 2 million years of the birth of the solar system. Short-lived radioactive material that was incorporated into bodies that formed during this epoch heated them to the point where—in cases like Vesta—the objects melted, allowing the dens\n\n## From: Solar_System\n This Section\n  1. … 2.

If it were sliced in half horizontally at the equator – picture a squished oval – it would measure 173 miles (280 kilometers) across at its widest point and 144 miles (232 kilometers) long. Its surface area is 64,000 square miles (165,800 square kilometers).\nUp until recently, the scientific consensus was that the asteroid Psyche consisted mostly of metal. The more recent data indicates that the asteroid is possibly a mix of metal and silicate, the same material found in glass and sand. The best analysis indicates that Psyche is likely made of a mixture of rock and metal, with metal composing 30% to 60% of its volume. The asteroid’s composition has been determined by radar observations and by the measurements of the asteroid’s thermal inertia (how quickly an object gains or re-radiates heat).\nBy combining radar and optical observations, scientists generated a 3D model of Psyche that shows evidence of two craterlike depressions. It suggests that there is significant variation in the metal content and color of the asteroid over its surface. But until NASA's Psyche mission sees the asteroid Psyche up close for the first time, we will not know what it actually looks like.\nUnable to render the provided source\nScientists think Psyche may consist of significant amounts of metal from the core of a planetes\n\n## From: Solar_System\n Exploration to FIRST Robotics 2025  article 5 days ago 5 min read NASA’s Lunar Drill Technology Passes Tests on the Moon article 5 days ago 2 min read NASA Technology Enables Leaps in Artificial Intelligence article 5 days ago Highlights 9 min read ARMD Research Solicitations (Updated May 1) article 3 days ago 3 min read NASA Invests in Future STEM Workforce Through Space Grant Awards  article 3 days ago 7 min read ¿Qué es una caminata espacial?

The bright materials appear to be native rocks, while the dark material is believed to have been deposited by other asteroids crashing into Vesta. Scientists on the Dawn team estimate that about 300 dark asteroids with diameters ranging from one to 10 km (0.6 to six miles) hit Vesta during the last 3.5 billion years. This would have been enough to wrap the Vesta in a blanket of material about three to seven feet (one to two meters) thick.\nAn extensive system of troughs encircles Vesta's equatorial region. The largest, named Divalia Fossa, is bigger than the Grand Canyon.\nVesta appears to be the source of the Howardite, Eucrite and Diogenite groups of meteorites that have been found on Earth. They help scientists understand the \"Lunar Cataclysm,\" when a repositioning of the gas-giant planets billions of years ago destabilized the orbits of asteroids in the early asteroid belt and triggered a solar-system-wide bombardment. They also provide clues to Vesta's geochemical evolution, a story that was tested and enhanced by the information Dawn provided about the asteroid's surface and interior.\nVesta is believed to have lost about one percent of its mass less than a billion years ago in a massive collision responsible for the Rheasilvia crater, which is about 310 miles (500 kilometers) wide—some 95 percent of the asteroid's mean diameter. The Vesta family of asteroids is probably debris from this collision. Another huge crater is Veneneia, which is about 250 miles (400 km) in diameter.

The shoebox-sized LICIACube (Light Italian CubeSat for Imaging of Asteroids) split apart from DART several days before DART’s impact with the moonlet. LICIACube captured images of the impact and material (ejecta) kicked up from the moonlet. An image captured by the Italian Space Agency’s LICIACube a few minutes after DART collided with Dimorphos on Sept. 26, 2022.\nASI/NASA Size and Distance Didymos, the larger asteroid of the binary pair (also called Didymos A) is about a half mile (780 meters) in diameter. The moonlet, Dimorphos (Didymos B), is about 525 feet (160 meters) in diameter.\nAs it orbits the Sun, the asteroid pair comes close to Earth's orbit, occasionally approaching relatively close to our planet. In 2003, it passed only 0.048 AU from Earth. (One astronomical unit, abbreviated as AU, is the distance from the Sun to Earth.) At its farthest, when Didymos is on the opposite side of the Sun from Earth, a bit beyond the orbit of Mars, it is about 3 AU away. Orbit and Rotation The orbit of Didymos ranges from just outside the orbit of Earth (about 1 AU) to a bit beyond the orbit of Mars (about 2.27 AU) and is slightly inclined with respect to the plane of the planets (called the ecliptic), by about 3 degrees. It takes 2.11 years to make each trip around the Sun.\nDidymos is classified as a member of the Amor group of asteroids, named after asteroid 1221 Amor.

The smallest discernible features are about 120 yards (110 meters) across.\nNASA/JPL-Caltech Discovery Comet 19P/Borrelly was discovered by Alphonse Louis Nicolas Borrelly on Dec. 28, 1904, in Marseille, France. Overview With a shape resembling a chicken leg, the nucleus of comet 19P/Borrelly is approximately 5 miles (8 kilometers) long. The nucleus is inside a much larger cloud of gas and dust known as the \"coma.\"\nBorrelly follows an elliptical orbit around the Sun, looping from inside the orbit of Mars to outside the orbit of Jupiter and back again. It is a \"Jupiter-family comet,\" with an orbital period of fewer than 20 years that has been significantly modified by the gravity of Jupiter. (Astronomers have discovered hundreds of Jupiter family comets.)\nIt takes 6.9 years for Borrelly to orbit the Sun once. The comet last reached perihelion, its closest approach to the Sun, in 2015. NASA's Deep Space 1 spacecraft encountered comet Borrelly on Sept. 22, 2001. Flying by at a speed of 10 miles (16.6 kilometers) per second (more than 37,000 mph, or almost 60,000 kph), Deep Space 1 traveled within 1,349 miles (2,171 kilometers) of the\n\n## From: Solar_System\n2,171 kilometers) of the comet's nucleus. The spacecraft captured the best pictures of any comet's nucleus at the time and collected other valuable scientific data as well.\nDeep Space 1, which was launched in 1998, was designed to test high-risk, advanced technologies on an operational interplanetary mission. Technologies proven by this mission have been used to benefit almost all deep-space missions since then. One of the most exotic technologies, ion propulsion, was essential for the success of NASA's Dawn mission to Vesta and Ceres. How This Comet Got Its Name Comets are usually named for their discoverer(s) or for the name of the observatory or telescope used in the discovery. Since Alphonse Borrelly discovered this comet, it is named after him. The letter \"P\" indicates that 19P/Borrelly is a \"periodic\" comet, meaning it has an orbital period of less than 200 years.\nKeep Exploring Discover More Topics From NASA Sun Planets Asteroids, Comets & Meteors Kuiper Belt National Aeronautics and Space Administration NASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery.\n  * About NASA's Mission Join Us * Home * News & Events * Multimedia * NASA+ * Missions * Humans in Space * Earth * The Solar System * The Universe * Science * Aeronautics * Technology * Learning Resources * About NASA * NASA en Español Follow NASA More NASA Social Accounts NASA Newsletters Sitemap For Media Privacy Policy FOIA No FEAR Act Office of the IG Budget & Annual Reports Agency Financial Reports Contact NASA Accessibility Page Last Updated: \nNov 03, 2024 Page Editor: \nAMANDA BARNETT Responsible NASA Official for Science: \nDana Bolles\n\n* Explore Search * News & Events ### News & Events * Recently Published * Video Series on NASA+ *\n\n## From: Solar_System\n different from that found on Earth, the detection of both molecular nitrogen and molecular oxygen for the first time at a comet, the existence of exposed water ice on the comet’s surface, and the discovery of amino acid glycine (commonly found in proteins) and phosphorus (a component of DNA and cell membranes) in the comet.

Tempel 1 last reached perihelion (closest approach to the Sun) in 2016.\nTempel 1 is a Jupiter-family comet. A Jupiter-family comet is defined as having an orbital period of less than 20 years and one that has been modified by close passages with the gas giant. It takes 5.56 years for Tempel 1 to orbit the Sun once. However, Tempel 1's orbit is changing slowly over time. When Tempel 1 was first discovered, its orbit measured 5.68 years.\nTempel 1 is a small comet. Its nucleus measures approximately 3.73 miles\n\n# Key Entities (LLM Graph)\n\n## COMETS (CELESTIAL_OBJECT)\nCelestial objects, many of which are part of our solar system and are believed to originate in the Oort Cloud.\n\n## 19P/BORRELLY (CELESTIAL_OBJECT)\nA specific comet listed under 'Featured Comets'.\n\n## ALPHONSE BORRELLY (PERSON)\nThe astronomer who discovered comet 19P/Borrelly on Dec. 28, 1904, in Marseille, France.\n\n## MARSEILLE (GEOGRAPHICAL_FEATURE)\nCity in France where comet 19P/Borrelly was discovered by Alphonse Louis Nicolas Borrelly.\n\n## COMET ENCKE (CELESTIAL_OBJECT)\nA featured comet, also known as Borrelly.\n\n## 67P (CELESTIAL_OBJECT)\nA periodic comet where molecular nitrogen, oxygen, water ice, glycine, and phosphorus were discovered.

The period varies from appearance to appearance because of the gravitational effects of the planets. Measured from one perihelion passage to the next, Halley's period has been as short as 74.42 years (1835-1910) and as long as 79.25 years (451-530).\nThe comet's closest approach to Earth occurred in 837, at a distance of 0.033 AU (3.07 million miles or 4.94 million kilometers). At that time, April 10, 837, Halley reached a total apparent brightness of about magnitude -3.5, nearly that of Venus at greatest brilliance. The light of Halley was spread over an extended area, however, so its surface brightness was less than that of Venus.\nDuring its 1986 appearance, Halley's nearest approach to Earth occurred on the outbound leg of the trip at a distance of 0.42 AU (39 million miles or 63 million kilometers). It was slightly brighter than the north star Polaris but again spread over a much larger area than a point-like star.\nAt aphelion in 1948, Halley was 35.25 AU (3.28 billion miles or 5.27 billion kilometers) from the Sun, well beyond the distance of Neptune. The comet was moving 0.91 kilometers per second (2,000 mph). At perihelion on Feb. 9, 1986, Halley was only 0.5871 AU (87.8 million km: 54.6 million miles) from the Sun, well inside the orbit of Venus. Halley was moving at 122,000 mph (54.55 kilometers per second). Lifetime With each orbit around the Sun, a comet the size of Halley loses an estimated 3 to 10 feet (1 to 3 meters) of material from the surface of its nucleus. Thus, as the comet ages, it eventually dims in appearance and\n\n## From: Solar_System\nic\" comet was later named in his honor.\nThe comet has since been connected to ancient observations going back more than 2,000 years. It is featured in the famous Bayeux tapestry, which chronicles the Battle of Hastings in 1066.\nIn 1986, an international fleet spacecraft met the comet for an unprecedented study from a variety of vantage points. The science fleet included Japan's Suisei and Sakigake spacecraft, the Soviet Union's Vega 1 and Vega 2 (repurposed after a successful Venus mission), the international ISEE-3 (ICE) spacecraft, and the European Space Agency's Giotto. NASA's Pioneer 7 and Pioneer 12 also contributed to the bounty of science data collected. A panel from the Bayeux tapestry showing people looking at what would later be known as Halley's comet.\nBy Myrabella - Own work, Public Domain Halley's Connection to Meteor Showers Each time Halley returns to the inner solar system its nucleus sprays ice and rock into space. This debris stream results in two weak meteor showers each year: the Eta Aquarids in May and the Orionids in October. Size Halley's dimensions are about 9.3 by 5 miles (15 kilometers by 8 kilometers). It is one of the darkest, or least reflective, objects in the solar system. It has an albedo of 0.03, which means that it reflects only 3% of the light that falls on it. Orbit Comet Halley moves backward (opposite to Earth's motion) around the Sun in a plane tilted 18 degrees to that of the Earth's orbit. Halley's backward, or retrograde, motion is unusual among short-period comets, as its greatest distance from the Sun (aphelion) is beyond the orbit of Neptune.\nHalley's orbit period is, on average, 76 Earth years. This corresponds to an orbital circumference around the Sun of about 7.6 billion\n\n## From: Solar_System\n, it takes sunlight about six minutes to travel from the Sun to Venus.\nEarth's nearness to Venus is a matter of perspective. The planet is nearly as big around as Earth. Its diameter at its equator is about 7,521 miles (12,104 kilometers), versus 7,926 miles (12,756 kilometers) for Earth. From Earth, Venus is the brightest object in the night sky after our own Moon. The ancients, therefore, gave it great importance in their cultures, even thinking it was two objects: a morning star and an evening star. That’s where the trick of perspective comes in.\nBecause Venus’ orbit is closer to the Sun than ours, the two of them – from our viewpoint – never stray far from each other. The ancient Egyptians and Greeks saw Venus in two guises: first in one orbital position (seen in the morning), then another (your “evening” Venus), just at different times of the year.\nAt its nearest to Earth , Venus is about 24 million (about 38 million kilometers) away. But most of the time the two planets are farther apart. The maximum distance between Venus and Earth is about 162 million miles (261 million kilometers). Mercury, the innermost planet, actually spends more time in Earth’s proximity than Venus.\nOne more trick of perspective: how Venus looks through binoculars or a telescope. Keep watch over many months, and you’ll notice that Venus has phases, just like our Moon – full, half, quarter, etc. The complete cycle, however, new to full, takes 584 days, while our Moon takes just a month. And it was this perspective, the phases of Venus first observed by Galileo through his telescope, that provided the key scientific proof for the Copernican heliocentric nature of the solar system.

Li (PSI), C.M. Lisse (JHU Overview On Oct. 19, 2014, The nucleus of comet C/2013 A1 Siding Spring missed Mars by about one-third of the distance between Earth and Earth's moon or one-tenth the distance at which any identified comet has flown past Earth. That presented a unique science opportunity for the five orbiting spacecraft and two rovers at the Red Planet.\nThe comet approached Mars almost head-on as the planet traveled on its own orbit around the Sun, so they passed each other at an enormous velocity—some 35 miles (56 kilometers) per second. But the comet had such a large coma that Mars traveled through high-speed dust and gas particles for hours. The orbiting spacecraft took shelter behind Mars, but they also used their instruments two capture information about a rare close interaction between a comet and a planet.\nComet Siding Spring fell from the Oort cloud, an immense spherical shell of dormant comets that envelopes the rest of the solar system. To get a feel for how far away it is, consider this: Voyager 1, which has been traveling through space since 1977, is much farther away than any of the planets and has even emerged from the heliosphere, the enormous bubble of magnet\n\n## From: Solar_System\nón espacial 2024 article 3 months ago 11 min read La NASA identifica causa de pérdida de material del escudo térmico de Orion de Artemis I article 5 months ago Explore This Section\n  1. … 2.

Astronomers have now linked the comet's appearances to observations dating back more than 2,000 years.\nHalley was last seen in Earth's skies in 1986 and was met in space by an international fleet of spacecraft. It will return in 2061 on its regular 76-year journey around the Sun. The History of Halley's Comet Until the time of English astronomer Edmond Halley (1656-1742), comets were believed to make only one pass through the solar system.\nBut in 1705, Halley used Isaac Newton's theories of gravitation and planetary motions to compute the orbits of several comets. Halley found the similarities in the orbits of bright comets reported in 1531, 1607, and 1682 and he suggested that the trio was actually a single comet making return trips. Halley correctly predicted the comet would return in 1758. History's first known \"periodic\" comet was later named in\n\n## From: Solar_System\n's controlled impact on the comet's surface on Sept. 30, 2016.\nChuryumov-Gerasimenko loops around the Sun in an orbit that crosses those of Jupiter and Mars, approaching but not reaching Earth's orbit. Like most Jupiter Family comets, it is thought to have fallen from the Kuiper Belt, a region beyond Neptune's orbit, as a result of one or more collisions or gravitational tugs.\nAnalysis of the comet's orbital evolution indicates that until the mid-19th century, the closest it got to the Sun was 4.0 AU (about 373 million miles or 600 million kilometers), which is roughly two-thirds of the way from Mars' orbit to that of Jupiter. That far from the Sun's heat, it would not sprout a coma or tails, so it was invisible from Earth.\nBut scientists calculate that in 1840, a fairly close encounter with Jupiter must have sent the comet flying deeper into the inner solar system, down to about 3.0 AU (about 280 million miles or 450 million kilometers) from the Sun. Churyumov-Gerasimenko's perihelion (closest approach to the Sun) drifted a bit closer to the Sun over the next century, and then Jupiter gave the comet another gravitational kick in 1959. Since then, the comet's perihelion has stood at about 1.3 AU, which is about 27 million miles (43 million kilometers) outside Earth's orbit.\nThe comet's nucleus is thought to be quite porous, giving it a density much lower than that of water. When heated by the Sun, it is thought to emit about twice as much dust as gas.\nBesides collecting a vast amount of data on the properties of the comet, including its interior, surface, and the surrounding gas, dust, and plasma, Rosetta’s key findings included the discovery of water vapor in the comet that is significantly different from that found on Earth,\n\n## From: Solar_System\n Hubble History article 6 days ago Highlights 4 min read El X-59 de la NASA completa las pruebas electromagnéticas article 2 months ago 1 min read Mejores imágenes de Ciencia en la estación espacial 2024 article 2 months ago 11 min read La NASA identifica causa de pérdida de material del escudo térmico de Orion de Artemis I article 5 months ago Explore This Section\n  1. … 2.

A. Mechain on Jan. 17, 1786. Other astronomers located this comet in subsequent passages, but these sightings were not defined as the same comet until Johann Franz Encke calculated its orbit. Overview Comet 2P/Encke is a small comet. Its nucleus measures approximately 2.98 miles (4.8 kilometers) in diameter, which is about a third of the size of the object hypothesized to have led to the demise of the dinosaurs.\nIt takes 3.30 years for Enke to orbit the sun once. Comet Encke has the shortest orbital period of any known comet within our solar system. Encke last reached perihelion (closest approach to the sun) in 2015.\nComet Enke is the parent comet of the Taurid meteor stream. The Taurids, which peak in October/November of each year, are fast meteors (65,000 mph or 104,607 kph) and are known for their fireballs. Fireballs are meteors that are as bright or brighter than the planet Venus (seen in the morning or evening skies at around a visual magnitude of -4\n\n## From: Solar_System\n around a visual magnitude of -4). They may exhibit larger explosions of light and color and can persist longer than an average meteor streak. This is due to the fact that fireballs originate from larger particles of cometary material. Oftentimes, this particular shower exhibits fireballs on or around Halloween, making them known as the Halloween Fireballs.\nComet Encke approached the sun for its close encounter in 2013 at the same time as the much talked about and imaged comet ISON, and because of this was imaged by both the MESSENGER and STEREO spacecraft. A visualization of the constant outflow of material from the Sun, known as the solar wind.\nESA/NASA/SOHO How This Comet Got Its Name Comets are usually named for their discoverer(s) or for the name of the observatory/telescope used in the discovery. However, this comet is not named after its discoverer(s). Instead it is named after Johann Franz Encke who calculated the comet's orbit. The letter P indicates that 2P/Encke is a periodic comet. Periodic comets have an orbital period of less than 200 years.\nKeep Exploring Discover More Topics From NASA Sun Planets Asteroids, Comets & Meteors Kuiper Belt National Aeronautics and Space Administration NASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery.\n  * About NASA's Mission Join Us * Home * News & Events * Multimedia * NASA+ * Missions * Humans in Space * Earth * The Solar System * The Universe * Science * Aeronautics * Technology * Learning Resources * About NASA * NASA en Español Follow NASA More NASA Social Accounts NASA Newsletters Sitemap For Media Privacy Policy FOIA No FEAR Act Office of the IG Budget & Annual Reports Agency Financial Reports Contact NASA Accessibility Page Last Updated: \nNov\n\n## From: Solar_System\n-Gerasimenko Borisov Encke Wild 2 Tempel 1 Hale-Bopp Siding Spring ISON 'Oumuamua Shoemaker-Levy 9 Resources Solar System Home 19P/Borrelly In this Deep Space 1 image of comet Borrelly, sunlight illuminates the bowling-pin shaped nucleus from directly below. At this distance, many features become vivid on the surface of the nucleus, including a jagged line between day and night on the comet, rugged terrain on both ends with dark patches, and smooth, brighter terrain near the center. The smallest discernible features are about 120 yards (110 meters) across.\nNASA/JPL-Caltech Discovery Comet 19P/Borrelly was discovered by Alphonse Louis Nicolas Borrelly on Dec. 28, 1904, in Marseille, France. Overview With a shape resembling a chicken leg, the nucleus of comet 19P/Borrelly is approximately 5 miles (8 kilometers) long. The nucleus is inside a much larger cloud of gas and dust known as the \"coma.\"\nBorrelly follows an elliptical orbit around the Sun, looping from inside the orbit of Mars to outside the orbit of Jupiter and back again. It is a \"Jupiter-family comet,\" with an orbital period of fewer than 20 years that has been significantly modified by the gravity of Jupiter. (Astronomers have discovered hundreds of Jupiter family comets.)\nIt takes 6.9 years for Borrelly to orbit the Sun once. The comet last reached perihelion, its closest approach to the Sun, in 2015. NASA's Deep Space 1 spacecraft encountered comet Borrelly on Sept. 22, 2001. Flying by at a speed of 10 miles (16.6 kilometers) per second (more than 37,000 mph, or almost 60,000 kph), Deep Space 1 traveled within 1,349 miles (2,171 kilometers) of the\n\n## From: Solar_System\n nucleus measures approximately 3.73 miles (6 kilometers) in diameter, which is about half the size of the object hypothesized to have led to the demise of the dinosaurs.\nTwo missions have encountered this comet: Deep Impact in 2005 and Stardust NExT in in 2011.\nDeep Impact sent an impactor into Tempel 1, becoming the first spacecraft to eject material from the surface of a comet. Changes in the surface of Tempel 1 were obscured by all the material ejected during and after the collision. The impact site was then re-imaged by a second mission, Stardust NExT, in 2011. Any changes were hard to distinguish when compared with pre-impact images. How This Comet Got Its Name Comets are usually named for their discoverer(s) or for the name of the observatory/telescope used in the discovery. Since Wilhelm Tempel discovered this comet it is named for him. The letter \"P\" indicates that 9P/Tempel 1 is a periodic comet.

Overview 81P/Wild (Wild 2) (Wild is pronounced vilt) is a small comet with the shape of a flattened sphere and measures about 1.03 x 1.24 x 1.71 miles (1.65 x 2 x 2.75 kilometers). It takes Wild 2 nearly six and a half years (6.41) to orbit the Sun once. Wild 2 last reached perihelion (closest approach to the Sun) in 2016.\nComet Wild 2 is known as a fresh periodic comet. Wild 2 orbits the Sun between Mars and Jupiter, but it did not always travel the course of its orbit here. Originally, this comet's orbit lay between that of Uranus and Jupiter.

When frozen, they are the size of a small town. When a comet's orbit brings it close to the Sun, it heats up and spews dust and gases into a giant glowing head larger than most planets. The dust and gases form a tail that stretches away from the Sun for millions of miles. There are likely billions of comets orbiting our Sun in the Kuiper Belt and even more distant Oort Cloud.

It was taken as the spacecraft flew by at a distance of about 435 miles (700 kilometers). Jets can be seen streaming out of the nucleus.\nNASA/JPL-Caltech/UMD Discovery Hartley 2 was discovered by Malcolm Hartley on March 15, 1986 using the Schmidt Telescope at the Siding Spring Observatory in Australia. Overview Comet 103P/Hartley (Hartley 2) is a small, oval (or peanut) shaped comet – its nucleus measures approximately one mile (1.6 kilometers) in diameter. It takes Hartley 2 about 6.47 years to orbit the Sun once. Hartley 2 last reached perihelion (closest approach to the Sun) in 2017.\nHartley 2 orbits the Sun within the asteroid belt, which lies between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Hartley 2 is a Jupiter-family comet. A Jupiter-family comet is defined as having an orbital period of less than 20 years and one that has been modified by close passages with the gas giant.\nOne spacecraft has encountered this comet: Deep Impact (EPOXI) in 2010. During its flyby, the spacecraft came within 431 miles (694 kilometers) of the comet. Hartley 2 was the fifth comet to be visited by spacecraft and was the second encounter made by this particular spacecraft. Deep Impact had previously visited comet 9P/Tempel 1 in 2005.\nCalled hyperactive by the EPOXI mission, comet Hartley 2 spins around one axis, while tumbling around another one. Comet Hartley's core is also not uniform, but is made up of water ice with methanol, carbon dioxide and possibly ethane. The release of these gases occur at different locations on the\n\n# Key Entities (LLM Graph)\n\n## COMETS (CELESTIAL_OBJECT)\nCelestial objects, many of which are part of our solar system and are believed to originate in the Oort Cloud.\n\n## 2P/ENCKE (CELESTIAL_OBJECT)\nA periodic comet with one of the shortest orbital periods, also known as Encke's Comet.\n\n## JOHANN FRANZ ENCKE (PERSON)\nAstronomer who calculated the orbit of Comet 2P/Encke, leading to it being defined as the same comet across multiple sightings.\n\n## COMET HARTLEY 2 (CELESTIAL_OBJECT)\nAlso known as Comet 103P/Hartley.

The dust also confirms that S-type (this refers to the asteroid's color spectrum) asteroids like Itokawa, which are the most common type of asteroid in the inner main belt, are the source of the most common kind of meteorite found on Earth: the ordinary chondrite.\nUnable to render the provided source\nScientists think Itokawa is not solid, but rather is a rubble pile, an agglomeration of rocks loosely held together by their mutual gravity. Few craters are visible, presumably because any impact energetic enough to create a crater shakes rocks loose and they fill the hole.\nOne sign that the asteroid was once part of a much larger object is that many of the captured dust particles show signs of having slowly cooled after forming deep inside a rocky object at a temperature of some 1,500 degrees Fahrenheit (800 degrees Celsius). For this to have occurred, the diameter of the rocky object would have to have been greater than 20 km (12 miles), whereas Itokawa's longest dimension is only 0.5 km (0.3 miles).\nAnother clue is that the largest boulder found on Itokawa is about 50 m (160 feet) across, which is believed to be too big to have been ejected by the impact that created the asteroid's largest crater. Scientists think the rock is a fragment of whatever cataclysmic event resulted in Itokawa's current construction.\nWriting in the journal Science, Hayabusa's science team described the asteroid's shape as resembling a sea otter, with one distinct part designated as the head and the other, larger part designated as the body. One of the scenarios that the team cited as most likely to explain this is that after Itokawa's parent body was shattered, the slight mutual gravity of the fragments brought them together into two or more rubble piles, and\n\n## From: Solar_System\n planet pass in front of a star. Formation Dwarf planet Haumea is a member of a group of objects that orbit in a disc-like zone beyond the orbit of Neptune called the Kuiper Belt. This distant realm is populated with thousands of miniature icy worlds which formed early in the history of our solar system about 4.5 billion years ago. These icy, rocky bodies are called Kuiper Belt objects, transneptunian objects, or plutoids. Structure Astronomers believe Haumea is made of rock with a coating of ice. Surface We know very little about Haumea's surface. Atmosphere We know very little about Haumea's atmosphere.

Asteroids Home Facts Exploration Featured Asteroids 2024 YR4 Apophis Psyche Bennu Dinkinesh and Selam Donaldjohanson Didymos and Dimorphos Vesta Eros Ida and Dactyl Itokawa Resources Solar System Home Vesta Overview Vesta is the second most massive body in the main asteroid belt, accounting for almost 9% of the total mass of all asteroids. Only dwarf planet Ceres is more massive in that region of rocky debris between Mars and Jupiter. NASA’s Dawn spacecraft circled Vesta from July 16, 2011, until Sept. 5, 2012, when it departed and began its journey to dwarf planet Ceres.\nThe giant asteroid is almost spherical, and so is nearly classified a dwarf planet. Unlike most known asteroids, Vesta has separated into crust, mantle and core (a characteristic known as being differentiated), much like Earth.\nUnderstanding why this is so was one of the objectives of the Dawn mission. The answer turned out to be that Vesta formed early, within 1 to 2 million years of the birth of the solar system. Short-lived radioactive material that was incorporated into bodies that formed during this epoch heated them to the point where—in cases like Vesta—the objects melted, allowing the dens\n\n## From: Solar_System\n nucleus measures approximately 3.73 miles (6 kilometers) in diameter, which is about half the size of the object hypothesized to have led to the demise of the dinosaurs.\nTwo missions have encountered this comet: Deep Impact in 2005 and Stardust NExT in in 2011.\nDeep Impact sent an impactor into Tempel 1, becoming the first spacecraft to eject material from the surface of a comet. Changes in the surface of Tempel 1 were obscured by all the material ejected during and after the collision. The impact site was then re-imaged by a second mission, Stardust NExT, in 2011. Any changes were hard to distinguish when compared with pre-impact images. How This Comet Got Its Name Comets are usually named for their discoverer(s) or for the name of the observatory/telescope used in the discovery. Since Wilhelm Tempel discovered this comet it is named for him. The letter \"P\" indicates that 9P/Tempel 1 is a periodic comet. Periodic comets have an orbital period of less than 200 years.\nKeep Exploring Discover More Topics From NASA Sun Planets Asteroids, Comets & Meteors Kuiper Belt National Aeronautics and Space Administration NASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery.\n  * About NASA's Mission Join Us * Home * News & Events * Multimedia * NASA+ * Missions * Humans in Space * Earth * The Solar System * The Universe * Science * Aeronautics * Technology * Learning Resources * About NASA * NASA en Español Follow NASA More NASA Social Accounts NASA Newsletters Sitemap For Media Privacy Policy FOIA No FEAR Act Office of the IG Budget & Annual Reports Agency Financial Reports Contact NASA Accessibility Page Last Updated: \nApr 16, 2025 Page Editor: \nAMANDA BARNETT Responsible NASA Official for Science:\n\n## From: Solar_System\n is the Antarctic Search for Meteorites program.\nCredit: NASA/JSC/ANSMET What is a Meteor Shower? Scientists estimate that about 48.5 tons (44 tonnes or 44,000 kilograms) of meteoritic material falls on Earth each day. Almost all the material is vaporized in Earth's atmosphere, leaving a bright trail fondly called \"shooting stars.\" \nSeveral meteors per hour can usually be seen on any given night. Sometimes the number increases dramatically—these events are called meteor showers. A Perseid meteor over Joshua Tree National Park in 2015.\nCredit: National Park Service/Brad Sutton.\nMeteor showers occur annually or at regular intervals as the Earth passes through the trail of dusty debris left by a comet. Meteor showers are usually named after a star or constellation that is close to where the meteors appear in the sky. Perhaps the most famous are the Perseids, which peak in August every year. Every Perseid meteor is a tiny piece of the comet Swift-Tuttle, which swings by the Sun every 135 years.

Li (PSI), C.M. Lisse (JHU Overview On Oct. 19, 2014, The nucleus of comet C/2013 A1 Siding Spring missed Mars by about one-third of the distance between Earth and Earth's moon or one-tenth the distance at which any identified comet has flown past Earth. That presented a unique science opportunity for the five orbiting spacecraft and two rovers at the Red Planet.\nThe comet approached Mars almost head-on as the planet traveled on its own orbit around the Sun, so they passed each other at an enormous velocity—some 35 miles (56 kilometers) per second. But the comet had such a large coma that Mars traveled through high-speed dust and gas particles for hours. The orbiting spacecraft took shelter behind Mars, but they also used their instruments two capture information about a rare close interaction between a comet and a planet.\nComet Siding Spring fell from the Oort cloud, an immense spherical shell of dormant comets that envelopes the rest of the solar system. To get a feel for how far away it is, consider this: Voyager 1, which has been traveling through space since 1977, is much farther away than any of the planets and has even emerged from the heliosphere, the enormous bubble of magnet\n\n## From: Solar_System\nosphere, the enormous bubble of magnetism and ionized gas that the Sun emits. But it will take the spacecraft another 300 years to reach the inner \"edge\" of the Oort cloud and, at its current speed of a million miles a day, some 30,000 years more to finish passing through it.\nOccasionally, some gravitational influence-possibly from a passing star-nudges a comet loose from this incredibly vast and distant depository, and it falls toward the Sun. That is what must have happened to Siding Spring a few million years ago. It has been falling all this time toward the inner solar system, and it's going to give us just one shot at studying it. According to current estimates, its next visit will be in about 740,000 years. Discovery Discovered Jan. 3, 2013 at Siding Spring Observatory, Australia.

The image shows dust concentrated around the nucleus, but the nucleus itself was too small to be seen by Hubble.\nNASA, ESA and D. Jewitt (UCLA) In Depth Comet 2I/Borisov is the first confirmed interstellar comet. It was discovered by Crimean amateur astronomer Gennady Borisov on Aug. 30, 2019, and quickly became a global phenomenon. After a week of observations by amateur and professional astronomers worldwide, scientists determined the path of the fleeting visitor and confirmed it came from outside our solar system. \nNASA’s Hubble Space Telescope captured images of comet 2I/Borisov in October and December of 2019, as it streaked through our solar system at a breakneck speed of about 110,000 miles (177,000 kilometers) per hour. The images showed a lot of dust around a bright nucleus, though the nucleus itself was too small to be seen by Hubble.\nIn March 2020, scientists using Hubble noticed a distinct change in the comet’s appearance: Instead of the single bright inner core spotted in previous images, the images indicated a fragment had broken away from the nucleus. Scientists will continue to use Hubble to monitor the comet.\nOnly one other visitor from another solar system has been spotted, an object officially named 'Oumuamua .

Surface Mercury's surface resembles that of Earth's Moon, scarred by many impact craters resulting from collisions with meteoroids and comets. Craters and features on Mercury are named after famous deceased artists, musicians, or authors, including children's author Dr. Seuss and dance pioneer Alvin Ailey.\nVery large impact basins, including Caloris (960 miles or 1,550 kilometers in diameter) and Rachmaninoff (190 miles, or 306 kilometers in diameter), were created by asteroid impacts on the planet's surface early in the solar system's history. While there are large areas of smooth terrain, there are also cliffs, some hundreds of miles long and soaring up to a mile high. They rose as the planet's interior cooled and contracted over the billions of years since Mercury formed.\nMost of Mercury's surface would appear greyish-brown to the human eye. The bright streaks are called \"crater rays.\" They are formed when an asteroid or comet strikes the surface. The tremendous amount of energy that is released in such an impact digs a big hole in the ground, and also crushes a huge amount of rock under the point of impact. Some of this crushed material is thrown far from the crater and then falls to the surface, forming the rays. Fine particles of crushed rock are more reflective than large pieces, so the rays look brighter. The space environment – dust impacts and solar-wind particles – causes the rays to darken with time.\nTemperatures on Mercury are extreme. During the day, temperatures on the surface can reach 800 degrees Fahrenheit (430 degrees Celsius). Because the planet has no atmosphere to retain that heat, nighttime temperatures on the surface can drop to minus 290 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 180 degrees Celsius).\nMercury may have water ice at its north and south poles inside deep craters, but only in regions in permanent shadows. In those shadows, it could be cold enough\n\n## From: Solar_System\n shadows, it could be cold enough to preserve water ice despite the high temperatures on sunlit parts of the planet. Atmosphere Instead of an atmosphere, Mercury possesses a thin exosphere made up of atoms blasted off the surface by the solar wind and striking meteoroids. Mercury's exosphere is composed mostly of oxygen, sodium, hydrogen, helium, and potassium. Magnetosphere Mercury's magnetic field is offset relative to the planet's equator. Though Mercury's magnetic field at the surface has just 1% the strength of Earth's, it interacts with the magnetic field of the solar wind to sometimes create intense magnetic tornadoes that funnel the fast, hot solar wind plasma down to the surface of the planet. When the ions strike the surface, they knock off neutrally charged atoms and send them on a loop high into the sky.\nKeep Exploring Discover More Topics From NASA Sun Planets Asteroids, Comets & Meteors Kuiper Belt National Aeronautics and Space Administration NASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery.\n  * About NASA's Mission Join Us * Home * News & Events * Multimedia * NASA+ * Missions * Humans in Space * Earth * The Solar System * The Universe * Science * Aeronautics * Technology * Learning Resources * About NASA * NASA en Español Follow NASA More NASA Social Accounts NASA Newsletters Sitemap For Media Privacy Policy FOIA No FEAR Act Office of the IG Budget & Annual Reports Agency Financial Reports Contact NASA Accessibility Page Last Updated: \nApr 25, 2025 Page Editor: \nAMANDA BARNETT Responsible NASA Official for Science: \nDana Bolles\n\n* Explore Search * News & Events ### News & Events * Recently Published * Video Series on NASA+ * Podcasts * Blogs * Newsletters * Social Media * Media Resources * Multimedia ### Multimedia * Images * Videos on NASA\n\n## From: Solar_System\n Mercury: Facts Mercury Home Facts Exploration Resources Solar System Home Our Solar System Mercury Facts Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system and nearest to the Sun. It's only slightly larger than Earth's Moon. From the surface of Mercury, the Sun would appear more than three times as large as it does when viewed from Earth, and the sunlight would be as much as seven times brighter. Introduction Namesake Potential for Life Size and Distance Orbit and Rotation Moons Rings Formation Structure Surface Atmosphere Magnetosphere Introduction Mercury's crater Debussy can be seen toward the bottom of this image from NASA's MESSENGER spacecraft.\nCredits: NASA/Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory/Carnegie Institution of Washington\nMercury's surface temperatures are both extremely hot and cold. Because the planet is so close to the Sun, day temperatures can reach highs of 800°F (430°C). Without an atmosphere to retain that heat at night, temperatures can dip as low as -290°F (-180°C).\nDespite its proximity to the Sun, Mercury is not the hottest planet in our solar system – that title belongs to nearby Venus, thanks to its dense atmosphere. But Mercury is the fastest planet, zipping around the Sun every 88 Earth days. Namesake Mercury is appropriately named for the swiftest of the ancient Roman gods. Potential for Life Mercury's environment is not conducive to life as we know it. The temperatures and solar radiation that characterize this planet are most likely too extreme for organisms to adapt to. Size and Distance With a radius of 1,516 miles (2,440 kilometers), Mercury is a little more than 1/3 the width of Earth. If Earth were the size of a nickel, Mercury would be about as big as a blueberry.\nFrom an average distance of 36 million miles (58 million kilometers), Mercury is 0.4 astronomical units away from the Sun. One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth\n\n## From: Solar_System\n three times taller than Earth's Mt. Everest with a base the size of the state of New Mexico.\nMars appears to have had a watery past, with ancient river valley networks, deltas, and lakebeds, as well as rocks and minerals on the surface that could only have formed in liquid water. Some features suggest that Mars experienced huge floods about 3.5 billion years ago.\nThere is water on Mars today, but the Martian atmosphere is too thin for liquid water to exist for long on the surface. Today, water on Mars is found in the form of water-ice just under the surface in the polar regions as well as in briny (salty) water, which seasonally flows down some hillsides and crater walls. Atmosphere Mars has a thin atmosphere made up mostly of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and argon gases. To our eyes, the sky would be hazy and red because of suspended dust instead of the familiar blue tint we see on Earth. Mars' sparse atmosphere doesn't offer much protection from impacts by such objects as meteorites, asteroids, and comets.\nThe temperature on Mars can be as high as 70 degrees Fahrenheit (20 degrees Celsius) or as low as about -225 degrees Fahrenheit (-153 degrees Celsius). And because the atmosphere is so thin, heat from the Sun easily escapes this planet. If you were to stand on the surface of Mars on the equator at noon, it would feel like spring at your feet (75 degrees Fahrenheit or 24 degrees Celsius) and winter at your head (32 degrees Fahrenheit or 0 degrees Celsius).\nOccasionally, winds on Mars are strong enough to create dust storms that cover much of the planet. After such storms, it can be months before all of the dust settles. Magnetosphere Mars has no global magnetic field today, but areas of the Martian crust in the southern hemisphere are highly magnetized, indicating traces of a magnetic field from 4 billion years ago.\nKeep Exploring Discover\n\n## From: Solar_System\n, Jupiter's spots can persist for many years. Stormy Jupiter is swept by over a dozen prevailing winds, some reaching up to 335 miles per hour (539 kilometers per hour) at the equator. The Great Red Spot, a swirling oval of clouds twice as wide as Earth, has been observed on the giant planet for more than 300 years. More recently, three smaller ovals merged to form the Little Red Spot, about half the size of its larger cousin. Findings from NASA’s Juno probe released in October 2021 provide a fuller picture of what’s going on below those clouds. Data from Juno shows that Jupiter’s cyclones are warmer on top, with lower atmospheric densities, while they are colder at the bottom, with higher densities. Anticyclones, which rotate in the opposite direction, are colder at the top but warmer at the bottom.\nThe findings also indicate these storms are far taller than expected, with some extending 60 miles (100 kilometers) below the cloud tops and others, including the Great Red Spot, extending over 200 miles (350 kilometers). This surprising discovery demonstrates that the vortices cover regions beyond those where water condenses and clouds form, below the depth where sunlight warms the atmosphere.\nThe height and size of the Great Red Spot mean the concentration of atmospheric mass within the storm potentially could be detectable by instruments studying Jupiter’s gravity field. Two close Juno flybys over Jupiter’s most famous spot provided the opportunity to search for the storm’s gravity signature and complement the other results on its depth.\nWith their gravity data, the Juno team was able to constrain the extent of the Great Red Spot to a depth of about 300 miles (500 kilometers) below the cloud tops. Belts and Zones In addition to cyclones and anticyclones, Jupiter is known for its distinctive belts and zones – white and reddish bands of clouds that wrap around the planet. Strong\n\n## From: Solar_System\nest impact craters of any rocky planet.\nOther notable features of the Venus landscape include:\n  * A volcanic crater named Sacajawea for Lewis and Clark’s Native American guide.\n  * A deep canyon called Diana for the Roman goddess of the hunt.\n  * “Pancake” domes with flat tops and steep sides, as wide as 38 miles (62 kilometers), likely formed by the extrusion of highly viscous lava.\n  * “Tick” domes, odd volcanoes with radiating spurs that, from above, make them look like their blood-feeding namesake.\n  * Tesserae, terrain with intricate patterns of ridges and grooves that suggest the scorching temperatures make rock behave in some ways more like peanut butter beneath a thin and strong chocolate layer on Venus. Atmosphere Venus’ atmosphere is one of extremes. With the hottest surface in the solar system, apart from the Sun itself, Venus is hotter even than the innermost planet, charbroiled Mercury. The atmosphere is mostly carbon dioxide – the same gas driving the greenhouse effect on Venus and Earth – with clouds composed of sulfuric acid. And at the surface, the hot, high-pressure carbon dioxide behaves in a corrosive fashion. But higher up in the atmosphere, temperatures and pressure begin to ease. Magnetosphere Even though Venus is similar in size to Earth and has a similar-sized iron core, the planet does not have its own internally generated magnetic field. Instead, Venus has what is known as an induced magnetic field. This weak magnetic field is created by the interaction of the Sun's magnetic field and the planet's outer atmosphere. Ultraviolet light from the Sun excites gases in Venus' outermost atmosphere; these electrically excited gases are called ions, and thus this region is called the ionosphere (Earth has an ionosphere as well). The solar wind – a million-mile-per-hour g\n\n## From: Solar_System\n boil away because incredibly high pressure keeps it locked inside. Surface Neptune does not have a solid surface. Its atmosphere (made up mostly of hydrogen, helium, and methane) extends to great depths, gradually merging into water and other melted ices over a heavier, solid core with about the same mass as Earth. Atmosphere Neptune's atmosphere is made up mostly of hydrogen and helium with just a little bit of methane. Neptune's neighbor Uranus has a similar makeup; the methane absorbs other colors but reflects blue, giving these ice giants their similar hue. Many images of Neptune, coming from the Voyager 2 flyby in 1989, show Neptune as a much deeper blue. This was because the Voyager team tweaked the images, to better reveal clouds and other distinctive features on the planet, compared to the hazy, uniform view of Uranus that Voyager 2 had captured in 1986. Researchers in 2024 re-processed the images , showing the planets look much more alike than many thought.\nNeptune is our solar system's windiest world. Despite its great distance and low energy input from the Sun, Neptune's winds can be three times stronger than Jupiter's and nine times stronger than Earth's. These winds whip clouds of frozen methane across the planet at speeds of more than 1,200 miles per hour (2,000 kilometers per hour). Even Earth's most powerful winds hit only about 250 miles per hour (400 kilometers per hour).\nIn 1989 a large, oval-shaped storm in Neptune's southern hemisphere dubbed the \"Great Dark Spot\" was large enough to contain the entire Earth. That storm has since disappeared, but new ones have appeared on different parts of the planet. Magnetosphere The main axis of Neptune's magnetic field is tipped over by about 47 degrees compared with the planet's rotation axis. Like Uranus, whose magnetic axis is tilted about 60 degrees from the axis of rotation, Neptune's magnetosphere undergoes wild variations during each rotation because of this misalignment.

The closest it comes to the Sun is 76 AU, while at its farthest it travels out to ~1200 AU. Centaurs Centaurs are objects with orbits that travel through the space between the orbits of Jupiter and Neptune. Objects in these orbits interact strongly with the gravity of the giant planets. Because of these powerful gravitational encounters, most are fated to either be ejected from the solar system or pushed into the inner solar system where they become comets or crash into the Sun and planets.\nThis process – the removal of the Centaurs – is ongoing, taking tens of millions of years for the typical Centaur object. Thus, the fact that there are Centaurs around today is evidence that they're being actively supplied from somewhere else. Astronomers think the most likely explanation is that they're relatively recent escapees from the Kuiper Belt. In fact, Centaurs are understood to be scattered objects, like those in the scattered disk – the difference being that the Centaurs have been scattered closer to the Sun by Neptune, rather than farther out. Pluto's Place in the Kuiper Belt In 1930, Pluto became the first Kuiper Belt object to be discovered. It was found at a time before astronomers had reason to expect a large population of icy worlds beyond Neptune. Today it's known as the \"King of the Kuiper Belt\" – and it's the largest object in the region, even though another object similar in size, called Eris, has a slightly higher mass. Pluto’s orbit is said to be in resonance with the orbit of Neptune, meaning Pluto's orbit is in a stable, repeating pattern with Neptune's.

Only dwarf planet Ceres is more massive in that region of rocky debris between Mars and Jupiter. NASA’s Dawn spacecraft circled Vesta from July 16, 2011, until Sept. 5, 2012, when it departed and began its journey to dwarf planet Ceres.\nThe giant asteroid is almost spherical, and so is nearly classified a dwarf planet. Unlike most known asteroids, Vesta has separated into crust, mantle and core (a characteristic known as being differentiated), much like Earth.\nUnderstanding why this is so was one of the objectives of the Dawn mission. The answer turned out to be that Vesta formed early, within 1 to 2 million years of the birth of the solar system. Short-lived radioactive material that was incorporated into bodies that formed during this epoch heated them to the point where—in cases like Vesta—the objects melted, allowing the dens\n\n## From: Solar_System\n planet pass in front of a star.

Our solar system is located in the Milky Way, a barred spiral galaxy with two major arms, and two minor arms. Our Sun is in a small, partial arm of the Milky Way called the Orion Arm, or Orion Spur, between the Sagittarius and Perseus arms. Our solar system orbits the center of the galaxy at about 515,000 mph (828,000 kph). It takes about 230 million years to complete one orbit around the galactic center.\nUnable to render the provided source Namesake Our planetary system is called “the solar system” because we use the word “solar” to describe things related to our star, after the Latin word for Sun, \"solis.\" Potential for Life So far, we've only know about life on Earth, but NASA is searching for life on other worlds in our solar system and beyond. Size and Distance Our solar system extends much farther than the planets that orbit the Sun. The solar system also includes the Kuiper Belt that lies past Neptune's orbit. This is a ring of icy bodies, almost all smaller than the most popular Kuiper Belt Object – dwarf planet Pluto .\nBeyond the fringes of the Kuiper Belt is the Oort Cloud . This giant spherical shell surrounds our solar system. It has never been directly observed, but its existence is predicted based on mathematical models and observations of comets that likely originate there.\nThe Oort Cloud is made of icy pieces of space debris - some bigger than mountains – orbiting our Sun as far as 1.6 light-years away.

Asteroids range in size from Vesta – the largest at about 329 miles (530 kilometers) in diameter – to bodies that are less than 33 feet (10 meters) across. The total mass of all the asteroids combined is less than that of Earth's Moon. What if We Discovered an Asteroid Headed for Earth?

Center for Near Earth\n\n## From: Solar_System\n. Astronomers think there are millions of small, icy objects in this region – including hundreds of thousands that are larger than 60 miles (100 kilometers) wide. Some of the objects, including Pluto, are over 600 miles (1,000 kilometers) wide. In addition to rock and water ice, objects in the Kuiper Belt also contain a variety of other frozen compounds like ammonia and methane.\nSimilar to the asteroid belt, the Kuiper Belt is a region of leftovers from the solar system's early history. Like the asteroid belt, it has also been shaped by a giant planet, although it's more of a thick disk (like a donut) than a thin belt.\nThe Kuiper Belt shouldn't be confused with the Oort Cloud, which is a much more distant region of icy, comet-like bodies that surrounds the solar system, including the Kuiper Belt. Both the Oort Cloud and the Kuiper Belt are thought to be sources of comets.\nThe Kuiper Belt is truly a frontier in space – it's a place we're still just beginning to explore and our understanding is still evolving. Namesake The region is named for astronomer Gerard Kuiper, who published a scientific paper in 1951 that speculated about objects beyond Pluto. Astronomer Kenneth Edgeworth also mentioned objects beyond Pluto in papers he published in the 1940s, and thus it's sometimes referred to as the Edgeworth-Kuiper Belt. Some researchers prefer to call it the Trans-Neptunian Region, and refer to Kuiper Belt objects (KBOs) as trans-Neptunian objects, or TNOs.\nWhatever your preferred term is, the belt occupies an enormous volume in our solar system, and the small worlds that inhabit it have a lot to tell us about early history. These two multiple-exposure images from NASA's Hubble Space Telescope show Kuiper Belt objects, or KBOs\n\n# Key Entities (LLM Graph)\n\n## CENTAURS (ASTEROID)\nA class of icy bodies, considered an

Surface Mercury's surface resembles that of Earth's Moon, scarred by many impact craters resulting from collisions with meteoroids and comets. Craters and features on Mercury are named after famous deceased artists, musicians, or authors, including children's author Dr. Seuss and dance pioneer Alvin Ailey.\nVery large impact basins, including Caloris (960 miles or 1,550 kilometers in diameter) and Rachmaninoff (190 miles, or 306 kilometers in diameter), were created by asteroid impacts on the planet's surface early in the solar system's history. While there are large areas of smooth terrain, there are also cliffs, some hundreds of miles long and soaring up to a mile high. They rose as the planet's interior cooled and contracted over the billions of years since Mercury formed.\nMost of Mercury's surface would appear greyish-brown to the human eye. The bright streaks are called \"crater rays.\" They are formed when an asteroid or comet strikes the surface. The tremendous amount of energy that is released in such an impact digs a big hole in the ground, and also crushes a huge amount of rock under the point of impact. Some of this crushed material is thrown far from the crater and then falls to the surface, forming the rays. Fine particles of crushed rock are more reflective than large pieces, so the rays look brighter. The space environment – dust impacts and solar-wind particles – causes the rays to darken with time.\nTemperatures on Mercury are extreme. During the day, temperatures on the surface can reach 800 degrees Fahrenheit (430 degrees Celsius). Because the planet has no atmosphere to retain that heat, nighttime temperatures on the surface can drop to minus 290 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 180 degrees Celsius).\nMercury may have water ice at its north and south poles inside deep craters, but only in regions in permanent shadows. In those shadows, it could be cold enough\n\n## From: Solar_System\n Mercury: Facts Mercury Home Facts Exploration Resources Solar System Home Our Solar System Mercury Facts Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system and nearest to the Sun. It's only slightly larger than Earth's Moon. From the surface of Mercury, the Sun would appear more than three times as large as it does when viewed from Earth, and the sunlight would be as much as seven times brighter.

Because the planet is so close to the Sun, day temperatures can reach highs of 800°F (430°C). Without an atmosphere to retain that heat at night, temperatures can dip as low as -290°F (-180°C).\nDespite its proximity to the Sun, Mercury is not the hottest planet in our solar system – that title belongs to nearby Venus, thanks to its dense atmosphere. But Mercury is the fastest planet, zipping around the Sun every 88 Earth days. Namesake Mercury is appropriately named for the swiftest of the ancient Roman gods. Potential for Life Mercury's environment is not conducive to life as we know it. The temperatures and solar radiation that characterize this planet are most likely too extreme for organisms to adapt to. Size and Distance With a radius of 1,516 miles (2,440 kilometers), Mercury is a little more than 1/3 the width of Earth. If Earth were the size of a nickel, Mercury would be about as big as a blueberry.\nFrom an average distance of 36 million miles (58 million kilometers), Mercury is 0.4 astronomical units away from the Sun. One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth\n\n## From: Solar_System\nest impact craters of any rocky planet.\nOther notable features of the Venus landscape include:\n  * A volcanic crater named Sacajawea for Lewis and Clark’s Native American guide.\n  * A deep canyon called Diana for the Roman goddess of the hunt.\n  * “Pancake” domes with flat tops and steep sides, as wide as 38 miles (62 kilometers), likely formed by the extrusion of highly viscous lava.\n  * “Tick” domes, odd volcanoes with radiating spurs that, from above, make them look like their blood-feeding namesake.\n  * Tesserae, terrain with intricate patterns of ridges and grooves that suggest the scorching temperatures make rock behave in some ways more like peanut butter beneath a thin and strong chocolate layer on Venus. Atmosphere Venus’ atmosphere is one of extremes. With the hottest surface in the solar system, apart from the Sun itself, Venus is hotter even than the innermost planet, charbroiled Mercury. The atmosphere is mostly carbon dioxide – the same gas driving the greenhouse effect on Venus and Earth – with clouds composed of sulfuric acid. And at the surface, the hot, high-pressure carbon dioxide behaves in a corrosive fashion. But higher up in the atmosphere, temperatures and pressure begin to ease. Magnetosphere Even though Venus is similar in size to Earth and has a similar-sized iron core, the planet does not have its own internally generated magnetic field. Instead, Venus has what is known as an induced magnetic field. This weak magnetic field is created by the interaction of the Sun's magnetic field and the planet's outer atmosphere. Ultraviolet light from the Sun excites gases in Venus' outermost atmosphere; these electrically excited gases are called ions, and thus this region is called the ionosphere (Earth has an ionosphere as well).

Atmosphere Instead of an atmosphere, Mercury possesses a thin exosphere made up of atoms blasted off the surface by the solar wind and striking meteoroids. Mercury's exosphere is composed mostly of oxygen, sodium, hydrogen, helium, and potassium. Magnetosphere Mercury's magnetic field is offset relative to the planet's equator. Though Mercury's magnetic field at the surface has just 1% the strength of Earth's, it interacts with the magnetic field of the solar wind to sometimes create intense magnetic tornadoes that funnel the fast, hot solar wind plasma down to the surface of the planet. When the ions strike the surface, they knock off neutrally charged atoms and send them on a loop high into the sky.\nKeep Exploring Discover More Topics From NASA Sun Planets Asteroids, Comets & Meteors Kuiper Belt National Aeronautics and Space Administration NASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery.\n  * About NASA's Mission Join Us * Home * News & Events * Multimedia * NASA+ * Missions * Humans in Space * Earth * The Solar System * The Universe * Science * Aeronautics * Technology * Learning Resources * About NASA * NASA en Español Follow NASA More NASA Social Accounts NASA Newsletters Sitemap For Media Privacy Policy FOIA No FEAR Act Office of the IG Budget & Annual Reports Agency Financial Reports Contact NASA Accessibility Page Last Updated: \nApr 25, 2025 Page Editor: \nAMANDA BARNETT Responsible NASA Official for Science: \nDana Bolles\n\n* Explore Search * News & Events ### News & Events * Recently Published * Video Series on NASA+ * Podcasts * Blogs * Newsletters * Social Media * Media Resources * Multimedia ### Multimedia * Images * Videos on NASA\n\n## From: Solar_System\nthe objects melted, allowing the denser materials to sink to the asteroid's core and the lower density materials to rise.\nUnable to render the provided source\nVesta has one of the largest brightness ranges observed on any rocky body in our solar system. The bright materials appear to be native rocks, while the dark material is believed to have been deposited by other asteroids crashing into Vesta. Scientists on the Dawn team estimate that about 300 dark asteroids with diameters ranging from one to 10 km (0.6 to six miles) hit Vesta during the last 3.5 billion years. This would have been enough to wrap the Vesta in a blanket of material about three to seven feet (one to two meters) thick.\nAn extensive system of troughs encircles Vesta's equatorial region. The largest, named Divalia Fossa, is bigger than the Grand Canyon.\nVesta appears to be the source of the Howardite, Eucrite and Diogenite groups of meteorites that have been found on Earth. They help scientists understand the \"Lunar Cataclysm,\" when a repositioning of the gas-giant planets billions of years ago destabilized the orbits of asteroids in the early asteroid belt and triggered a solar-system-wide bombardment. They also provide clues to Vesta's geochemical evolution, a story that was tested and enhanced by the information Dawn provided about the asteroid's surface and interior.\nVesta is believed to have lost about one percent of its mass less than a billion years ago in a massive collision responsible for the Rheasilvia crater, which is about 310 miles (500 kilometers) wide—some 95 percent of the asteroid's mean diameter. The Vesta family of asteroids is probably debris from this collision. Another huge crater is Veneneia, which is about 250 miles (400 km) in diameter. Discovery Vesta was discovered at Bremen, Germany, on Mar. 29, 1807\n\n## From: Solar_System\n Our Planet Earth Science in Action Earth Multimedia Earth Data Earth Science Researchers The Solar System The Sun Mercury Venus Earth The Moon Mars Jupiter Saturn Uranus Neptune Pluto & Dwarf Planets Asteroids, Comets & Meteors The Kuiper Belt The Oort Cloud Skywatching The Universe Exoplanets The Search for Life in the Universe Stars Galaxies Black Holes The Big Bang Dark Matter Dark Energy Science Earth Science Planetary Science Astrophysics & Space Science The Sun & Heliophysics Biological & Physical Sciences Lunar Science Citizen Science Astromaterials Aeronautics Research Human Space Travel Research Aeronautics Science in the Air NASA Aircraft Flight Innovation Supersonic Flight Air Traffic Solutions Green Aviation Tech Drones & You Technology Technology Transfer & Spinoffs Space Travel Technology Technology Living in Space Manufacturing and Materials Robotics Science Instruments Computing Learning Resources For Kids and Students For Educators For Colleges and Universities For Professionals Science for Everyone Requests for Exhibits, Artifacts, or Speakers STEM Engagement at NASA About NASA NASA's Impacts Centers and Facilities Directorates Organizations People of NASA Careers Internships Our History Doing Business with NASA Get Involved Contact NASA en Español Ciencia Aeronáutica Ciencias Terrestres Sistema Solar Universo News & Events Recently Published Video Series on NASA+ Podcasts Blogs Newsletters Social Media Media Resources Multimedia Images Videos on NASA+ Sounds and Ringtones Interactives NASA Apps Podcasts e-Books STEM Multimedia Highlights 2 min read Hubble Images a Peculiar Spiral article 3 days ago 6 min read NASA’s SPHEREx Space Telescope Begins Capturing Entire Sky article 3 days ago 4 min read NASA’s Chandra Diagnoses Cause of Fracture in Galactic “Bone” article 3 days ago Highlights 1 min read HALO Arrives in the US article 4 days ago 3 min read Lunar Space Station Module for NASA’s Artemis Campaign to Begin Final Out\n\n# Key Entities (LLM Graph)\n\n## MERCURY (PLANET)\nA planet listed as a component under 'The Solar System' menu category.\n\n## CALORIS (CRATER)\nA very large impact basin (960 miles or 1,550 km in diameter) on Mercury, created by an asteroid impact.\n\n## RACHMANINOFF (CRATER)\nA very large impact basin (190 miles or 306 km in diameter) on Mercury, created by an asteroid impact.\n\n## CRATERS ON MERCURY (CRATER)\nImpact features on Mercury's surface, resulting from collisions with meteoroids and comets, and named after famous deceased artists, musicians, or authors.

Surrounding the inner core is the outer core. This layer is about 1,400 miles (2,300 kilometers) thick, made of iron and nickel fluids.\nIn between the outer core and crust is the mantle, the thickest layer. This hot, viscous mixture of molten rock is about 1,800 miles (2,900 kilometers) thick and has the consistency of caramel. The outermost layer, Earth's crust, goes about 19 miles (30 kilometers) deep on average on land. At the bottom of the ocean, the crust is thinner and extends about 3 miles (5 kilometers) from the seafloor to the top of the mantle. Surface Like Mars and Venus, Earth has volcanoes, mountains, and valleys. Earth's lithosphere, which includes the crust (both continental and oceanic) and the upper mantle, is divided into huge plates that are constantly moving. For example, the North American plate moves west over the Pacific Ocean basin, roughly at a rate equal to the growth of our fingernails. Earthquakes result when plates grind past one another, ride up over one another, collide to make mountains, or split and separate.\nEarth's global ocean, which covers nearly 70% of the planet's surface, has an average depth of about 2.5 miles (4 kilometers) and contains 97% of Earth's water. Almost all of Earth's volcanoes are hidden under these oceans. Hawaii's Mauna Kea volcano is taller from base to summit than Mount Everest, but most of it is underwater. Earth's longest mountain range is also underwater, at the bottom of the Arctic and Atlantic oceans. It is four times longer than the Andes, Rockies and Himalayas combined. Atmosphere Near the surface, Earth has an atmosphere that consists of 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, and 1% other gases such as argon,\n\n## From: Solar_System\n boil away because incredibly high pressure keeps it locked inside. Surface Neptune does not have a solid surface. Its atmosphere (made up mostly of hydrogen, helium, and methane) extends to great depths, gradually merging into water and other melted ices over a heavier, solid core with about the same mass as Earth. Atmosphere Neptune's atmosphere is made up mostly of hydrogen and helium with just a little bit of methane. Neptune's neighbor Uranus has a similar makeup; the methane absorbs other colors but reflects blue, giving these ice giants their similar hue. Many images of Neptune, coming from the Voyager 2 flyby in 1989, show Neptune as a much deeper blue. This was because the Voyager team tweaked the images, to better reveal clouds and other distinctive features on the planet, compared to the hazy, uniform view of Uranus that Voyager 2 had captured in 1986. Researchers in 2024 re-processed the images , showing the planets look much more alike than many thought.\nNeptune is our solar system's windiest world. Despite its great distance and low energy input from the Sun, Neptune's winds can be three times stronger than Jupiter's and nine times stronger than Earth's. These winds whip clouds of frozen methane across the planet at speeds of more than 1,200 miles per hour (2,000 kilometers per hour). Even Earth's most powerful winds hit only about 250 miles per hour (400 kilometers per hour).\nIn 1989 a large, oval-shaped storm in Neptune's southern hemisphere dubbed the \"Great Dark Spot\" was large enough to contain the entire Earth. That storm has since disappeared, but new ones have appeared on different parts of the planet. Magnetosphere The main axis of Neptune's magnetic field is tipped over by about 47 degrees compared with the planet's rotation axis. Like Uranus, whose magnetic axis is tilted about 60 degrees from the axis of rotation, Neptune's magnetosphere undergoes wild variations during each rotation because of this misalignment. The magnetic field\n\n## From: Solar_System\n other gases such as argon, carbon dioxide, and neon. The atmosphere affects Earth's long-term climate and short-term local weather and shields us from much of the harmful radiation coming from the Sun. It also protects us from meteoroids, most of which burn up in the atmosphere, seen as meteors in the night sky, before they can strike the surface as meteorites. Magnetosphere Our planet's rapid rotation and molten nickel-iron core give rise to a magnetic field, which the solar wind distorts into a teardrop shape in space. (The solar wind is a stream of charged particles continuously ejected from the Sun.) When charged particles from the solar wind become trapped in Earth's magnetic field, they collide with air molecules above our planet's magnetic poles. These air molecules then begin to glow and cause aurorae, or the northern and southern lights.\nThe magnetic field is what causes compass needles to point to the North Pole regardless of which way you turn. But the magnetic polarity of Earth can change, flipping the direction of the magnetic field. The geologic record tells scientists that a magnetic reversal takes place about every 400,000 years on average, but the timing is very irregular. As far as we know, such a magnetic reversal doesn't cause any harm to life on Earth, and a reversal is very unlikely to happen for at least another thousand years. But when it does happen, compass needles are likely to point in many different directions for a few centuries while the switch is being made. And after the switch is completed, they will all point south instead of north. 8 Need-to-Know Things About Our Home Planet Measuring Up If the Sun were as tall as a typical front door, Earth would be the size of a nickel. We're On It Earth is a rocky planet with a solid and dynamic surface of mountains, canyons, plains and more. Most of our planet is covered in water. Breathe Easy Earth's atmosphere is 78\n\n## From: Solar_System\n240 degrees Celsius).\nPluto's tallest mountains are 6,500 to 9,800 feet (2 to 3 kilometers) in height. The mountains are big blocks of water ice, sometimes with a coating of frozen gases like methane. Long troughs and valleys as long as 370 miles (600 kilometers) add to the interesting features of this faraway dwarf planet.\nCraters as large as 162 miles (260 kilometers) in diameter dot some of the landscape on Pluto, with some showing signs of erosion and filling. This suggests tectonic forces are slowly resurfacing Pluto.\nThe most prominent plains observed on Pluto appear to be made of frozen nitrogen gas and show no craters. These plains do show structures suggesting convection (blobs of material circulating up and down). Atmosphere Pluto has a thin, tenuous atmosphere that expands when it comes closer to the Sun and collapses as it moves farther away – similar to a comet. The main constituent is molecular nitrogen, though molecules of methane and carbon monoxide have also been detected.\nWhen Pluto is close to the Sun, its surface ices sublimate (changing directly from solid to gas) and rise to temporarily form a thin atmosphere. Pluto's low gravity (about 6% of Earth's) causes the atmosphere to be much more extended in altitude than our planet's atmosphere. Pluto becomes much colder during the part of each year when it is traveling far away from the Sun. During this time, the bulk of the planet's atmosphere may freeze and fall as snow to the surface. Magnetosphere It isn't known whether Pluto has a magnetic field, but its small size and slow rotation suggest little or none.\nKeep Exploring Discover More Topics From NASA Sun Planets Asteroids, Comets & Meteors Kuiper Belt National Aeronautics and Space Administration NASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery.\n  * About NASA's Mission Join\n\n## From: Solar_System\n three times taller than Earth's Mt. Everest with a base the size of the state of New Mexico.\nMars appears to have had a watery past, with ancient river valley networks, deltas, and lakebeds, as well as rocks and minerals on the surface that could only have formed in liquid water. Some features suggest that Mars experienced huge floods about 3.5 billion years ago.\nThere is water on Mars today, but the Martian atmosphere is too thin for liquid water to exist for long on the surface. Today, water on Mars is found in the form of water-ice just under the surface in the polar regions as well as in briny (salty) water, which seasonally flows down some hillsides and crater walls. Atmosphere Mars has a thin atmosphere made up mostly of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and argon gases. To our eyes, the sky would be hazy and red because of suspended dust instead of the familiar blue tint we see on Earth. Mars' sparse atmosphere doesn't offer much protection from impacts by such objects as meteorites, asteroids, and comets.\nThe temperature on Mars can be as high as 70 degrees Fahrenheit (20 degrees Celsius) or as low as about -225 degrees Fahrenheit (-153 degrees Celsius). And because the atmosphere is so thin, heat from the Sun easily escapes this planet. If you were to stand on the surface of Mars on the equator at noon, it would feel like spring at your feet (75 degrees Fahrenheit or 24 degrees Celsius) and winter at your head (32 degrees Fahrenheit or 0 degrees Celsius).\nOccasionally, winds on Mars are strong enough to create dust storms that cover much of the planet. After such storms, it can be months before all of the dust settles. Magnetosphere Mars has no global magnetic field today, but areas of the Martian crust in the southern hemisphere are highly magnetized, indicating traces of a magnetic field from 4 billion years ago.\nKeep Exploring Discover\n\n# Key Entities (LLM Graph)\n\n## EARTH (PLANET)\nA planet listed as a component under 'The Solar System' menu category.\n\n## NITROGEN (CHEMICAL_COMPOUND)\nA chemical element that makes up 78% of Earth's atmosphere near the surface.\n\n## MARS'S ATMOSPHERE (ENTITY)\nThe thin atmosphere of Mars, composed mainly of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and argon gases.\n\n## JUPITER ATMOSPHERE (GEOGRAPHICAL_FEATURE)\nThe Earth's atmosphere (referred to as 'our atmosphere' in the text) where comet debris trails collide and disintegrate.\n\n## MERCURY'S EXOSPHERE (CELESTIAL_OBJECT)\nA thin exosphere of Mercury, composed of atoms like oxygen, sodium, hydrogen, helium, and potassium, originating from its surface due to solar wind and meteoroid impacts.\n\n## ARGON (CHEMICAL_COMPOUND)\nA chemical element that is one of the other gases (1%) in Earth's atmosphere.\n\n## NEON (CHEMICAL_COMPOUND)\nA gas mentioned as being part of Earth's atmosphere.\n\n## CERES' ATMOSPHERE (ENTITY)\nA very thin layer of gases surrounding Ceres, containing water vapor.\n\n# Key Relationships (LLM Graph)\n\n- EARTH → Earth is listed as a topic under 'The Solar System' section, which is presented as content from NASA. → NASA (strength: 0.8)\n- EARTH → Earth's atmosphere consists of 1% other gases such as argon near the surface. → ARGON (strength: 0.7)\n- EARTH → Earth is the only world in our solar system with liquid water on the surface. → WATER (strength: 1.0)\n- EARTH → Earth's atmosphere is stated to be 78% nitrogen. → NITROGEN (strength: 0.9)\n- EARTH → The text states that Earth has one moon. → MOON (strength: 1.0)\n- EARTH → Earth is just slightly larger than nearby Venus. → VENUS (strength: 0.8)\n- EARTH → Earth's atmosphere consists of 78% nitrogen near the surface. → NITROGEN (strength: 0.8)\n- EARTH → Earth, like Venus, has volcanoes, mountains, and valleys. → VENUS (strength: 0.6)\n- EARTH → Earth has the Moon as its single moon. → MOON (strength: 1.0)\n- EARTH → Earth's temperature allows liquid water to exist for extended periods. → WATER (strength: 0.8)\n- EARTH → Earth is listed as a main section ('Explore Earth') on the NASA website, indicating it's a focus area for NASA. → NASA (strength: 0.7)\n- MARS'S ATMOSPHERE → Mars's thin atmosphere prevents liquid water from existing for long on the surface. → WATER (strength: 0.8)\n- MARS'S ATMOSPHERE → Mars's atmosphere contains argon gases. → ARGON (strength: 0.8)\n- MARS'S ATMOSPHERE → Mars's atmosphere contains nitrogen gas. → NITROGEN (strength: 0.8)\n- JUPITER ATMOSPHERE → Earth's atmosphere contains gases such as neon. → NEON (strength: 0.7)\n- JUPITER ATMOSPHERE → The atmosphere is described as Earth's atmosphere. → EARTH (strength: 0.9)\n- JUPITER ATMOSPHERE → Earth's atmosphere contains gases such as argon. → ARGON (strength: 0.7)\n- NITROGEN → Makemake may develop a very thin atmosphere, most likely made of nitrogen... → MAKEMAKE (strength: 0.8)\n- CERES' ATMOSPHERE → Ceres has a very thin atmosphere. → CERES (strength: 0.9)\n\n# Related Entities (LLM Graph)\n\n- **NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION** (TECHNOLOGY): The science or art involved with the study, design, and manufacturing of air flight capable machines, or the techniques of operating aircraft; mentioned as a NASA topic.\n- **ERIS** (CELESTIAL_OBJECT): A dwarf planet located in the scattered disk, and the largest known member of the Scattered Disk Objects population.\n- **MAKEMAKE** (PLANET): A dwarf planet located in the Kuiper Belt.

Strong east-west winds moving in opposite directions separate the bands. Juno previously discovered that these winds, or jet streams, reach depths of about 2,000 miles (roughly 3,200 kilometers). Researchers are still trying to solve the mystery of how the jet streams form. Data collected by Juno during multiple passes reveal one possible clue: that the atmosphere’s ammonia gas travels up and down in remarkable alignment with the observed jet streams.\nJuno’s data also shows that the belts and zones undergo a transition around 40 miles (65 kilometers) beneath Jupiter’s water clouds. At shallow depths, Jupiter’s belts are brighter in microwave light than the neighboring zones. But at deeper levels, below the water clouds, the opposite is true – which reveals a similarity to our oceans. Polar Cyclones Juno previously discovered polygonal arrangements of giant cyclonic storms at both of Jupiter’s poles – eight arranged in an octagonal pattern in the north and five arranged in a pentagonal pattern in the south. Over time, mission scientists determined these atmospheric phenomena are extremely resilient, remaining in the same location.\nJuno data also indicates that, like hurricanes on Earth, these cyclones want to move poleward, but cyclones located at the center of each pole push them back. This balance explains where the cyclones reside and the different numbers at each pole. Magnetosphere The Jovian magnetosphere is the region of space influenced by Jupiter's powerful magnetic field. It balloons 600,000 to 2 million miles (1 to 3 million kilometers) toward the Sun (seven to 21 times the diameter of Jupiter itself) and tapers into a tadpole-shaped tail extending more than 600 million miles (1 billion kilometers) behind Jupiter, as far as Saturn's orbit. Jupiter's enormous magnetic field is 16 to 54 times as powerful as that of the Earth. It rotates with the planet and sweeps up particles that have an electric charge\n\n## From: Solar_System\n's powerful magnetic field. \nDeeper down, Jupiter's central core had long been a mystery. Scientists theorized Jupiter was a mostly homogeneous mix of hydrogen and helium gases, surrounding a small, solid core of heavier elements – ice, rock, and metal formed from debris and small objects swirling around that area of the embryonic solar system 4 billion years ago.\nNASA’s Juno spacecraft, measuring Jupiter’s gravity and magnetic field, found data suggesting the core is much larger than expected, and not solid. Instead, it’s partially dissolved, with no clear separation from the metallic hydrogen around it, leading researchers to describe the core as dilute, or “fuzzy.” Surface As a gas giant, Jupiter doesn’t have a true surface. The planet is mostly swirling gases and liquids. While a spacecraft would have nowhere to land on Jupiter, it wouldn’t be able to fly through unscathed either. The extreme pressures and temperatures deep inside the planet crush, melt, and vaporize spacecraft trying to fly into the planet. Atmosphere Jupiter's appearance is a tapestry of colorful stripes and spots – the cloud bands that encircle the planet, and the cyclonic storms dotting it from pole to pole. The gas planet likely has three distinct cloud layers in its \"skies\" that, taken together, span about 44 miles (71 kilometers). The top cloud is probably made of ammonia ice, while the middle layer is likely made of ammonium hydrosulfide crystals. The innermost layer may be made of water ice and vapor.\nThe vivid colors you see in thick bands across Jupiter may be plumes of sulfur and phosphorus-containing gases rising from the planet's warmer interior. Jupiter's fast rotation – spinning once every 10 hours – creates strong jet streams, separating its clouds into dark belts and bright zones across long stretches.\nWith no solid surface to slow them down, Jupiter's spots can persist for\n\n## From: Solar_System\n, Jupiter's spots can persist for many years. Stormy Jupiter is swept by over a dozen prevailing winds, some reaching up to 335 miles per hour (539 kilometers per hour) at the equator. The Great Red Spot, a swirling oval of clouds twice as wide as Earth, has been observed on the giant planet for more than 300 years. More recently, three smaller ovals merged to form the Little Red Spot, about half the size of its larger cousin. Findings from NASA’s Juno probe released in October 2021 provide a fuller picture of what’s going on below those clouds. Data from Juno shows that Jupiter’s cyclones are warmer on top, with lower atmospheric densities, while they are colder at the bottom, with higher densities. Anticyclones, which rotate in the opposite direction, are colder at the top but warmer at the bottom.\nThe findings also indicate these storms are far taller than expected, with some extending 60 miles (100 kilometers) below the cloud tops and others, including the Great Red Spot, extending over 200 miles (350 kilometers). This surprising discovery demonstrates that the vortices cover regions beyond those where water condenses and clouds form, below the depth where sunlight warms the atmosphere.\nThe height and size of the Great Red Spot mean the concentration of atmospheric mass within the storm potentially could be detectable by instruments studying Jupiter’s gravity field. Two close Juno flybys over Jupiter’s most famous spot provided the opportunity to search for the storm’s gravity signature and complement the other results on its depth.\nWith their gravity data, the Juno team was able to constrain the extent of the Great Red Spot to a depth of about 300 miles (500 kilometers) below the cloud tops. Belts and Zones In addition to cyclones and anticyclones, Jupiter is known for its distinctive belts and zones – white and reddish bands of clouds that wrap around the planet.

But it has the shortest day in the solar system, taking about 9.9 hours to spin around once on its axis. Introduction Namesake Potential for Life Size and Distance Orbit and Rotation Moons Rings Formation Structure Surface Atmosphere Magnetosphere Introduction NASA’s Juno spacecraft took three images of Jupiter’s Great Red on Feb. 12, 2019, that were used to create this color-enhanced view. At the time the images were taken, the spacecraft was between 16,700 miles (26,900 kilometers) and 59,300 miles (95,400 kilometers) above Jupiter's cloud tops.\nCredits: Enhanced image by Kevin M. Gill (CC-BY) based on images provided courtesy of NASA/JPL-Caltech/SwRI/MSSS\nJupiter's signature stripes and swirls are actually cold, windy clouds of ammonia and water, floating in an atmosphere of hydrogen and helium. The dark orange stripes are called belts, while the lighter bands are called zones, and they flow east and west in opposite directions. Jupiter’s iconic Great Red Spot is a giant storm bigger than Earth that has raged for hundreds of years.\nThe king of planets was named for Jupiter, king of the gods in Roman mythology. Most of its moons are also named for mythological characters, figures associated with Jupiter or his Greek counterpart, Zeus. Namesake Jupiter, being the biggest planet, gets its name from the king of the ancient Roman gods. Potential for Life Jupiter’s environment is probably not conducive to life as we know it. The temperatures, pressures, and materials that characterize this planet are most likely too extreme and volatile for organisms to adapt to.\nWhile planet Jupiter is an unlikely place for living things to take hold, the same is not true\n\n## From: Solar_System\n the solar system (even bigger than the planet Mercury). Callisto’s very few small craters indicate a small degree of current surface activity. A liquid-water ocean with the ingredients for life may lie beneath the frozen crust of Europa, the target of NASA's Europa Clipper mission slated to launch in 2024. \n› More on Jupiter's Moons Rings Discovered in 1979 by NASA's Voyager 1 spacecraft, Jupiter's rings were a surprise. The rings are composed of small, dark particles, and they are difficult to see except when backlit by the Sun. Data from the Galileo spacecraft indicate that Jupiter's ring system may be formed by dust kicked up as interplanetary meteoroids smash into the giant planet's small innermost moons. Formation Jupiter took shape along with rest of the solar system about 4.6 billion years ago. Gravity pulled swirling gas and dust together to form this gas giant. Jupiter took most of the mass left over after the formation of the Sun, ending up with more than twice the combined material of the other bodies in the solar system. In fact, Jupiter has the same ingredients as a star, but it did not grow massive enough to ignite.\nAbout 4 billion years ago, Jupiter settled into its current position in the outer solar system, where it is the fifth planet from the Sun. Structure The composition of Jupiter is similar to that of the Sun – mostly hydrogen and helium. Deep in the atmosphere, pressure and temperature increase, compressing the hydrogen gas into a liquid. This gives Jupiter the largest ocean in the solar system – an ocean made of hydrogen instead of water. Scientists think that, at depths perhaps halfway to the planet's center, the pressure becomes so great that electrons are squeezed off the hydrogen atoms, making the liquid electrically conducting like metal. Jupiter's fast rotation is thought to drive electrical currents in this region, with the spinning of the liquid metallic hydrogen acting like a dynamo, generating the planet's powerful magnetic field. \n\n\n## From: Solar_System\n up particles that have an electric charge. Near the planet, the magnetic field traps swarms of charged particles and accelerates them to very high energies, creating intense radiation that bombards the innermost moons and can damage spacecraft.\nJupiter's magnetic field also causes some of the solar system's most spectacular aurorae at the planet's poles.\nKeep Exploring Discover More Topics From NASA Sun Planets Asteroids, Comets & Meteors Kuiper Belt National Aeronautics and Space Administration NASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery.\n  * About NASA's Mission Join Us * Home * News & Events * Multimedia * NASA+ * Missions * Humans in Space * Earth * The Solar System * The Universe * Science * Aeronautics * Technology * Learning Resources * About NASA * NASA en Español Follow NASA More NASA Social Accounts NASA Newsletters Sitemap For Media Privacy Policy FOIA No FEAR Act Office of the IG Budget & Annual Reports Agency Financial Reports Contact NASA Accessibility Page Last Updated: \nApr 21, 2025 Page Editor: \nAMANDA BARNETT Responsible NASA Official for Science: \nDana Bolles\n\n* Explore Search * News & Events ### News & Events * Recently Published * Video Series on NASA+ * Podcasts * Blogs * Newsletters * Social Media * Media Resources * Multimedia ### Multimedia * Images * Videos on NASA+ * Sounds and Ringtones * Interactives * NASA Apps * Podcasts * e-Books * STEM Multimedia * NASA+ Search Suggested Searches Climate Change Artemis Expedition 64 Mars perseverance SpaceX Crew-2 International Space Station View All Topics A-Z Home Missions Humans in Space Earth The Solar System The Universe Science Aeronautics Technology Learning Resources About NASA Español News & Events Multimedia NASA+ Highlights 2 min readHubble Images a Pec\n\n## From: Solar_System\n planet pass in front of a star.

While most of the satellites orbiting other planets take their names from Greek or Roman mythology, Uranus' moons are unique in being named for characters from the works of William Shakespeare and Alexander Pope.\nAll of Uranus' inner moons appear to be roughly half water ice and half rock. The composition of the outer moons remains unknown, but they are likely captured asteroids. Rings Uranus has two sets of rings. The inner system of nine rings consists mostly of narrow, dark grey rings. There are two outer rings: the innermost one is reddish like dusty rings elsewhere in the solar system, and the outer ring is blue like Saturn's E ring.\nIn order of increasing distance from the planet, the rings are called Zeta, 6, 5, 4, Alpha, Beta, Eta, Gamma, Delta, Lambda, Epsilon, Nu, and Mu. Some of the larger rings are surrounded by belts of fine dust. Formation Uranus took shape when the rest of the solar system formed about 4.5 billion years ago – when gravity pulled swirling gas and dust in to become this ice giant. Like its neighbor Neptune, Uranus likely formed closer to the Sun and moved to the\n\n## From: Solar_System\n, less than 100 miles (160 kilometers) wide. They're also irregularly shaped, not spherical like Charon. Unlike many other moons in the solar system, these moons are not tidally locked to Pluto. They all spin and don’t keep the same face towards Pluto.\nPluto's moons are named for other mythological figures associated with the underworld. Charon is named for the river Styx boatman who ferries souls in the underworld (as well as honoring Charlene, the wife of discoverer James Christy, who was nicknamed Char). The small moon Nix is named for the goddess of darkness and night, who is also the mother of Charon. Hydra is named for the nine-headed serpent that guards the underworld. Kerberos is named after the three-headed dog of Greek mythology (known as Fluffy in the Harry Potter novels). And Styx is named for the mythological river that separates the world of the living from the realm of the dead. Rings There are no known rings around Pluto. Formation Dwarf planet Pluto is a member of a group of objects that orbit in a disc-like zone beyond the orbit of Neptune called the Kuiper Belt. This distant realm is populated with thousands of miniature icy worlds, which formed early in the history of our solar system about 4.5 billion years ago. These icy, rocky bodies are called Kuiper Belt objects, transneptunian objects, or plutoids. Structure Pluto is about two-thirds the diameter of Earth's Moon and probably has a rocky core surrounded by a mantle of water ice. Interesting ices like methane and nitrogen frost coat the surface. Due to its lower density, Pluto's mass is about one-sixth that of Earth's Moon. Surface Pluto's surface has mountains, valleys, plains, and craters. The temperature on Pluto can be as cold as -375 to -400 degrees Fahrenheit (-226 to -240 degrees Celsius).\nPluto\n\n## From: Solar_System\n Moons Neptune has 16 known moons. Neptune's largest moon Triton was discovered on Oct. 10, 1846, by William Lassell, just 17 days after Johann Gottfried Galle discovered the planet. Since Neptune was named for the Roman god of the sea, its moons are named for various lesser sea gods and nymphs in Greek mythology.\nTriton is the only large moon in the solar system that circles its planet in a direction opposite to the planet's rotation (a retrograde orbit), which suggests that it may once have been an independent object that Neptune captured. Triton is extremely cold, with surface temperatures around minus 391 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 235 degrees Celsius). And yet, despite this deep freeze at Triton, Voyager 2 discovered geysers spewing icy material upward more than 5 miles (8 kilometers). Triton's thin atmosphere, also discovered by Voyager, has been detected from Earth several times since, and is growing warmer, but scientists do not yet know why. Rings Neptune has at least five main rings and four prominent ring arcs that we know of so far. Starting near the planet and moving outward, the main rings are named Galle, Leverrier, Lassell, Arago, and Adams. The rings are thought to be relatively young and short-lived. In Neptune's outermost ring, material mysteriously clumps into arcs. Voyager 2 acquired this image as it encountered Neptune in August of 1989. \nCredits: NASA/JPL-Caltech\nNeptune's ring system also has peculiar clumps of dust called arcs. Four prominent arcs named Liberté (Liberty), Egalité (Equality), Fraternité (Fraternity), and Courage are in the outermost ring, Adams. The arcs are strange because the laws of motion would predict that they would spread out evenly rather than stay clumped together. Scientists now think the gravitational effects of Galatea, a moon just inward from the ring\n\n## From: Solar_System\n Voyager 2 in 1986.\nNASA/JPL-Caltech\nUranus is a very cold and windy world. The ice giant is surrounded by 13 faint rings and 28 small moons. Uranus rotates at a nearly 90-degree angle from the plane of its orbit. This unique tilt makes Uranus appear to spin sideways, orbiting the Sun like a rolling ball.\nUranus was the first planet found with the aid of a telescope. It was discovered in 1781 by astronomer William Herschel, although he originally thought it was either a comet or a star. It was two years later that the object was universally accepted as a new planet, in part because of observations by astronomer Johann Elert Bode. Namesake William Herschel tried unsuccessfully to name his discovery Georgium Sidus after King George III. Instead, the planet was named for Uranus, the Greek god of the sky, as suggested by Johann Bode. Potential for Life Uranus' environment is not conducive to life as we know it. The temperatures, pressures, and materials that characterize this planet are most likely too extreme and volatile for organisms to adapt to. Size and Distance With an equatorial diameter of 31,763 miles (51,118 kilometers), Uranus is four times wider than Earth. If Earth was the size of a nickel, Uranus would be about as big as a softball.\nFrom an average distance of 1.8 billion miles (2.9 billion kilometers), Uranus is about 19 astronomical units away from the Sun. One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth. From this distance, it takes sunlight 2 hours and 40 minutes to travel from the Sun to Uranus. Orbit and Rotation One day on Uranus takes about 17 hours. This is the amount of time it takes Uranus to rotate, or spin once around its axis. Uranus makes a complete orbit around the Sun (a year in Uran\n\n## From: Solar_System\n to the Sun and moved to the outer solar system about 4 billion years ago, where it is the seventh planet from the Sun. Structure Uranus is one of two ice giants in the outer solar system (the other is Neptune). Most (80% or more) of the planet's mass is made up of a hot dense fluid of \"icy\" materials – water, methane, and ammonia – above a small rocky core. Near the core, it heats up to 9,000 degrees Fahrenheit (4,982 degrees Celsius).\nUranus is slightly larger in diameter than its neighbor Neptune, yet smaller in mass. It is the second least dense planet; Saturn is the least dense of all.\nUranus gets its blue-green color from methane gas in the atmosphere. Sunlight passes through the atmosphere and is reflected back out by Uranus' cloud tops. Methane gas absorbs the red portion of the light, resulting in a blue-green color. Surface As an ice giant, Uranus doesn’t have a true surface. The planet is mostly swirling fluids. While a spacecraft would have nowhere to land on Uranus, it wouldn’t be able to fly through its atmosphere unscathed either. The extreme pressures and temperatures would destroy a metal spacecraft. Atmosphere Uranus' atmosphere is mostly hydrogen and helium, with a small amount of methane and traces of water and ammonia. The methane gives Uranus its signature blue color.\nWhile Voyager 2 saw only a few discrete clouds, a Great Dark Spot, and a small dark spot during its flyby in 1986 – more recent observations reveal that Uranus exhibits dynamic clouds as it approaches equinox, including rapidly changing bright features.\nUranus' planetary atmosphere, with a minimum temperature of 49K (-224.2 degrees Celsius) makes it even colder than Neptune in some places.\nWind speeds can reach up to 560 miles per hour (900 kilometers per hour) on Uranus. Winds are retro\n\n## From: Solar_System\n Sun is unusual compared to the planets: it's both elliptical and tilted. Pluto's 248-year-long, oval-shaped orbit can take it as far as 49.3 astronomical units (AU) from the Sun, and as close as 30 AU. (One AU is the mean distance between Earth and the Sun: about 93 million miles or 150 million kilometers.) But on average, Pluto is 3.7 billion miles (5.9 billion kilometers) away from the Sun, or 39 AU.\nFrom 1979 to 1999, Pluto was near perihelion, when it is closest to the Sun. During this time, Pluto was actually closer to the Sun than Neptune.\nOne day on Pluto takes about 153 hours. Its axis of rotation is tilted 57 degrees with respect to the plane of its orbit around the Sun, so it spins almost on its side. Pluto also exhibits a retrograde rotation; spinning from east to west like Venus and Uranus. Moons Pluto has five known moons: Charon, Nix, Hydra, Kerberos, and Styx. This moon system might have formed by a collision between Pluto and another similar-sized body early in the history of the solar system.\nCharon, the biggest of Pluto's moons, is about half the size of Pluto itself, making it the largest satellite relative to the planet it orbits in our solar system. It orbits Pluto at a distance of just 12,200 miles (19,640 kilometers). For comparison, our Moon is 20 times farther away from Earth. Pluto and Charon are often referred to as a double planet.\nCharon's orbit around Pluto takes 153 hours – the same time it takes Pluto to complete one rotation. This means Charon neither rises nor sets, but hovers over the same spot on Pluto's surface. The same side of Charon always faces Pluto, a state called tidal locking.\nPluto's other four moons are much smaller, less than 100 miles (160\n\n## From: Solar_System\n from 5,000 astronomical units to 100,000 astronomical units. One astronomical unit (or AU) is the distance from the Sun to Earth, or about 93 million miles (150 million kilometers). \nThe Oort Cloud is the boundary of the Sun's gravitational influence, where orbiting objects can turn around and return closer to our Sun.\nThe Sun's heliosphere doesn't extend quite as far. The heliosphere is the bubble created by the solar wind – a stream of electrically charged gas blowing outward from the Sun in all directions. The boundary where the solar wind is abruptly slowed by pressure from interstellar gases is called the termination shock. This edge occurs between 80-100 astronomical units.\nTwo NASA spacecraft launched in 1977 have crossed the termination shock: Voyager 1 in 2004 and Voyager 2 in 2007. Voyager 1 went interstellar in 2012 and Voyager 2 joined it in 2018. But it will be many thousands of years before the two Voyagers exit the Oort Cloud. The simulated view shows the position of the planets when Voyager 1 captured its one-of-a-kind solar system \"family portrait\" that shows six of our solar system's planets.\nNASA/JPL-Caltech Moons Our solar system has hundreds of moons orbiting planets, dwarf planets, and asteroids. \nOf the eight planets, Mercury and Venus are the only ones with no moons, although Venus does have a quasi-satellite that has officially been named Zoozve . \nThe giant planets Jupiter and Saturn lead our solar system’s moon counts. In some ways, the swarms of moons around these worlds resemble mini versions of our solar system. \nPluto, smaller than our own moon, has five moons in its orbit, including Charon, a moon so large it makes Pluto wobble.

It was the first member of the asteroid belt to be discovered when Giuseppe Piazzi spotted it in 1801. When NASA's Dawn arrived in 2015, Ceres became the first dwarf planet to receive a visit from a spacecraft.\nCalled an asteroid for many years, Ceres is so much bigger and so different from its rocky neighbors that scientists classified it as a dwarf planet in 2006. Even though Ceres comprises 25% of the asteroid belt's total mass, Pluto is still 14 times more massive. Namesake Ceres is named for the Roman goddess of corn and harvests. The word cereal comes from the same name. Potential for Life Ceres is one of the few places in our solar system where scientists would like to search for possible signs of life. Ceres has something a lot of other planets don't: water. Here on Earth, water is essential for life, so it's possible someplace else with that ingredient and a few other conditions could support life, as well. If anything does live on Ceres, it's likely to be very small microbes similar to bacteria. If Ceres does not have living things today, there may be signs it harbored life in the past. Size and Distance With a radius of 296 miles (476 kilometers), Ceres is 1/13 the radius of Earth. If Earth were the size of a nickel, Ceres would be about as big as a poppy seed.\nFrom an average distance of 257 million miles (413 million kilometers), Ceres is 2.8 astronomical units away from the Sun. One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth. From this distance, it takes sunlight 22 minutes to travel from the Sun to Ceres. Orbit and Rotation Ceres takes 1,682 Earth days, or 4.6 Earth years, to make one trip around the Sun. As Ceres orbits the Sun, it completes one\n\n## From: Solar_System\n orbits the Sun, it completes one rotation every 9 hours, making its day length one of the shortest in the solar system.\nCeres' axis of rotation is tilted just 4 degrees with respect to the plane of its orbit around the Sun. That means it spins nearly perfectly upright and doesn't experience seasons like other more tilted planets do. Moons Ceres does not have any moons. Rings Ceres does not have any rings. Formation Ceres formed along with the rest of the solar system about 4.5 billion years ago when gravity pulled swirling gas and dust in to become a small dwarf planet. Scientists describe Ceres as an \"embryonic planet,\" which means it started to form but didn't quite finish. Nearby Jupiter's strong gravity prevented it from becoming a fully formed planet. About 4 billion years ago, Ceres settled into its current location among the leftover pieces of planetary formation in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. Structure Ceres is more similar to the terrestrial planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars) than its asteroid neighbors, but it is much less dense. One of the similarities is a layered interior, but Ceres' layers aren’t as clearly defined. Ceres probably has a solid core and a mantle made of water ice. In fact, Ceres could be composed of as much as 25 percent water. If that is correct, Ceres has more water than Earth does. Ceres' crust is rocky and dusty with large salt deposits. The salts on Ceres aren’t like table salt (sodium chloride), but instead are made of different minerals like magnesium sulfate. Surface Ceres is covered in countless small, young craters, but none are larger than 175 miles (280 kilometers) in diameter. This is surprising, given that the dwarf planet must have been hit by numerous large asteroids during its 4.5 billion-year lifetime.\nThe lack of craters might be due to layers of ice just below the surface. The surface features could smooth out over time if ice\n\n## From: Solar_System\nris, the International Astronomical Union votes to change the definition of a planet. The new ruling reclassifies Pluto as a dwarf planet and reduces the number of planets in the solar system to eight. Both Eris and the asteroid Ceres are also classified as dwarf planets.\n  * Sep 14, 2006: The International Astronomical Union (IAU) announces that the dwarf planet known as Xena will be called Eris, after the Greek goddess of discord. Eris's moon is named Dysnomia, the demon goddess of lawlessness and the daughter of Eris. This is fitting since the discovery of Eris led to the demotion of Pluto from planet to dwarf planet amidst continuing debate in the science community and the public. Namesake This image of dwarf planet Eris (also known as 2003 UB313 or Xena,) was taken using the Samuel Oschin Telescope at the Palomar Observatory.\nOriginally designated 2003 UB313 – and nicknamed for the television warrior Xena by its discovery team – Eris is named for the ancient Greek goddess of discord and strife. The name fits since Eris remains at the center of a scientific debate about the definition of a planet. Potential for Life The surface of Eris is extremely cold, so it seems unlikely that life could exist there. Size and Distance With an equatorial diameter of about 1,500 miles (2,400 kilometers), Eris is about 1/5 the width of Earth. Eris, like Pluto, is a little smaller than Earth's Moon. If the Earth were the size of a nickel, Eris would be about as big as a popcorn kernel.\nFrom an average distance of 6.3 billion miles (10 billion kilometers), Eris is about 68 astronomical units away from the Sun. One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth. From this distance, it takes sunlight more than nine hours to travel from the Sun to the surface of E\n\n## From: Solar_System\n on Mar. 29, 1807 by Heinrich Wilhelm Olbers, who had previously discovered Pallas. He proposed—incorrectly as it turned out—that Ceres and Pallas were fragments of a destroyed planet, and found Vesta as he searched for more such objects. Vesta was the fourth asteroid ever to be discovered. How Vesta Got Its Name 4 Vesta’s discoverer, Heinrich Wilhelm Olbers, gave the honor of naming the new asteroid to German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss, who had computed its orbit. Gauss named it Vesta after the goddess of the hearth and household in Roman mythology.\nKeep Exploring Discover More Topics From NASA Sun Planets Asteroids, Comets & Meteors Kuiper Belt National Aeronautics and Space Administration NASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery.\n  * About NASA's Mission Join Us * Home * News & Events * Multimedia * NASA+ * Missions * Humans in Space * Earth * The Solar System * The Universe * Science * Aeronautics * Technology * Learning Resources * About NASA * NASA en Español Follow NASA More NASA Social Accounts NASA Newsletters Sitemap For Media Privacy Policy FOIA No FEAR Act Office of the IG Budget & Annual Reports Agency Financial Reports Contact NASA Accessibility Page Last Updated: \nApr 23, 2025 Page Editor: \nAMANDA BARNETT Responsible NASA Official for Science: \nDana Bolles\n\n* Explore Search * News & Events ### News & Events * Recently Published * Video Series on NASA+ * Podcasts * Blogs * Newsletters * Social Media * Media Resources * Multimedia ### Multimedia * Images * Videos on NASA+ * Sounds and Ringtones * Interactives * NASA Apps * Podcasts * e-Books * STEM Multimedia * NASA+ Search Suggested Searches Climate Change Artemis\n\n## From: Solar_System\n could smooth out over time if ice or another lower-density material, such as salt, is just below the surface. It's also possible that past hydrothermal activity, such as ice volcanoes, erased some large craters.\nWithin some of Ceres' craters, there are regions that are always in shadow. It's possible that without direct sunlight, these \"cold traps\" could have water ice in them for long periods of time. Atmosphere Ceres has a very thin atmosphere, and there is evidence it contains water vapor. The vapor may be produced by ice volcanoes or by ice near the surface sublimating (transforming from solid to gas). Magnetosphere Scientists don't think Ceres has a magnetosphere. Pop Culture The largest body in the asteroid belt, Ceres has amassed a number of references in science fiction stories of the 20th and 21st centuries. In the TV series \"The Expanse,\" Ceres is inhabited by humans, and in the PC Game Descent, one of the secret levels takes place on Ceres.\nIn the video game Destiny, Ceres was colonized by an alien race called the Fallen at the end of humanity's Golden Age.

It's a typical member of the Amors group of NEAs, which cross Mars' orbit but do not quite reach that of Earth. Unlike the much more numerous main-belt asteroids between Mars and Jupiter, NEAs are thought to be dead comets or fragments from main-belt asteroid collisions.\nEros was observed with ground-based telescopes for a century before our spacecraft gave us a close-up look, and was the subject of a worldwide observation campaign during its close approach to Earth in 1975 when it was only 14 million miles (22 million kilometers) away.

Charlois at Nice, France.\nWitt's discovery was the accidental byproduct of a two-hour photographic exposure he conducted of a different asteroid: 185 Eunike. Along with Eunike, the image he produced showed a 0.4-mm image trail, and observations on the following evening identified the object as one of unusually high apparent motion on the sky. Less than two weeks later, Adolf J. Berberich computed that the object's orbit brought it well inside the orbit of Mars, making it the first-known near-Earth asteroid. How Eros Got Its Name In a break with tradition at the time, the asteroid was given a male name: Eros, son of Mercury and\n\n## From: Solar_System\n escudo térmico de Orion de Artemis I article 5 months ago Explore This Section\n  1. … 2.

It is located in the distant Kuiper Belt. \nDiscovered in 1930, Pluto was long considered our solar system's ninth planet. But after the discovery of similar worlds deeper in the Kuiper Belt, Pluto was reclassified as a dwarf planet in 2006 by the International Astronomical Union.\nAccording to the 2006 IAU Resolution, \"a dwarf planet is an object in orbit around the\n\n## From: Solar_System\n is an object in orbit around the Sun that is large enough to pull itself into a nearly round shape but has not been able to clear its orbit of debris.\" The IAU stated that Pluto falls into the dwarf planet category because it is located in a part of our solar system known as the Trans-Neptunian region (beyond Neptune) where other objects might cross Pluto's orbital path.\nPluto is only about 1,400 miles wide. At that small size, Pluto is only about half the width of the United States. It's about 3.6 billion miles away from the Sun, and it has a thin atmosphere composed mostly of nitrogen, methane, and carbon monoxide. On average, Pluto’s temperature is -387°F (-232°C), making it too cold to sustain life.\nPluto is orbited by five known moons, the largest of which is Charon. Charon is about half the size of Pluto itself, making it the largest satellite relative to the planet it orbits in our solar system. Pluto and Charon are often referred to as a \"double planet.\"\nThe only spacecraft to explore Pluto up close was NASA's New Horizons. It flew by the dwarf planet and its moons in 2015. Namesake Pluto was named by an 11-year-old girl. \nIn 1930, Venetia Burney of Oxford, England, suggested to her grandfather that the new discovery be named for the Roman god of the underworld. He forwarded the name to the Lowell Observatory and it was selected.\nIn an interview with NASA in January 2006, Venetia said she offered the name Pluto over breakfast with her mother and grandfather. It was March 14, 1930, and her grandfather, Falconer Madan, had announced that scientists discovered the ninth planet.\n\"Venetia's interest and success in naming Pluto as a schoolgirl caught the attention of the world and earned her a place in the history of planetary astronomy that lives\n\n## From: Solar_System\n 2024 article 3 months ago 11 min read La NASA identifica causa de pérdida de material del escudo térmico de Orion de Artemis I article 5 months ago Explore This Section\n  * Planets Overview * What is a Planet? * Planet Sizes * Planet Temperatures * All Planets\n    * Mercury * Venus * Earth * Mars * Jupiter * Saturn * Uranus * Neptune * Pluto and Dwarf Planets * Exoplanets * Planetary Analogs\n    * About Planetary Analogs * Analog Explorer Gallery * 10 Things to Know * More\n    * Solar System Home About the Planets Our solar system has eight planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. There are five officially recognized dwarf planets in our solar system: Ceres, Pluto, Haumea, Makemake, and Eris.\n8 Planets 5 Dwarf Planets Introduction What is a planet? The word goes back to the ancient Greek word planēt, and it means \"wanderer.\" A more modern definition can be found in the Merriam-Webster dictionary which defines a planet as \"any of the large bodies that revolve around the Sun in the solar system.\"\nIn 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) - a group of astronomers that names objects in our solar system - agreed on their own definition of the word \"planet.\" This new definition changed caused Pluto's famous \"demotion\" to a dwarf planet.

Explore Venus Earth Facts Earth – our home planet – is the third\n\n## From: Solar_System\nris, the International Astronomical Union votes to change the definition of a planet. The new ruling reclassifies Pluto as a dwarf planet and reduces the number of planets in the solar system to eight. Both Eris and the asteroid Ceres are also classified as dwarf planets.\n  * Sep 14, 2006: The International Astronomical Union (IAU) announces that the dwarf planet known as Xena will be called Eris, after the Greek goddess of discord. Eris's moon is named Dysnomia, the demon goddess of lawlessness and the daughter of Eris. This is fitting since the discovery of Eris led to the demotion of Pluto from planet to dwarf planet amidst continuing debate in the science community and the public. Namesake This image of dwarf planet Eris (also known as 2003 UB313 or Xena,) was taken using the Samuel Oschin Telescope at the Palomar Observatory.\nOriginally designated 2003 UB313 – and nicknamed for the television warrior Xena by its discovery team – Eris is named for the ancient Greek goddess of discord and strife. The name fits since Eris remains at the center of a scientific debate about the definition of a planet. Potential for Life The surface of Eris is extremely cold, so it seems unlikely that life could exist there. Size and Distance With an equatorial diameter of about 1,500 miles (2,400 kilometers), Eris is about 1/5 the width of Earth. Eris, like Pluto, is a little smaller than Earth's Moon. If the Earth were the size of a nickel, Eris would be about as big as a popcorn kernel.\nFrom an average distance of 6.3 billion miles (10 billion kilometers), Eris is about 68 astronomical units away from the Sun. One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth. From this distance, it takes sunlight more than nine hours to travel from the Sun to the surface of E\n\n## From: Solar_System\n the history of planetary astronomy that lives on,\" said Alan Stern, the principal investigator for NASA's New Horizons mission that flew by Pluto on July 14, 2015.\nPluto's place in mythology can get a little muddled, so we asked Dr. Elizabeth Vandiver, chair of the Department of Classics in Whitman College in Walla Walla, Washington, to clarify the origins of the name.\nHere is her reply:\n\"Pluto is the name of the Roman god of the underworld, equivalent to the Greek Hades. \nHowever, the Greek name \"Plouton\" (from which the Romans derived their name \"Pluto\") was also occasionally used as an alternative name for Hades. But Pluto is definitely the Roman spelling.\" Venetia Burney, the girl who named Pluto.\nCourtesy: Venetia Burney Potential for Life The surface of Pluto is extremely cold, so it's unlikely that life could exist there. At such cold temperatures, water, which is vital for life as we know it, is essentially rock-like. Pluto's interior is warmer, however, and some think there could even be an ocean deep inside. Size and Distance Pluto has an equatorial diameter of about 1,477 miles (2,377 kilometers). Pluto is about 1/5th the width of Earth. \nFrom an average distance of about 3.7 billion miles (5.9 billion kilometers), Pluto is about 39 times farther away than the Earth is from the Sun. From this distance, it takes sunlight 5.5 hours to travel from the Sun to Pluto.\nIf you were to stand on the surface of Pluto at noon, the Sun would be 1/900 the brightness it is here on Earth, or about 300 times as bright as our full moon. There is a moment each day near sunset here on Earth when the light is the same brightness as midday on Pluto.

This distant realm is populated with thousands of miniature icy worlds which formed early in the history of our solar system about 4.5 billion years ago. These icy, rocky bodies are called Kuiper Belt objects, transneptunian objects, or plutoids. Structure Astronomers believe Haumea is made of rock with a coating of ice.

Bennu was the target of NASA's OSIRIS-REx, the first U.S. mission to collect a sample from an asteroid and deliver it to Earth on Sept. 24, 2023. * Bennu Facts \n  * Exploration \n  * Multimedia \n  * Asteroid & Comet Resources About Bennu Bennu is about one-third of a mile wide at its equator.\nThe rocks Bennu is made of formed nearly 4.6 billion years ago on a primeval world that has since been destroyed by a giant collision. Bennu coalesced from a small portion of the leftover rubble about 1 to 2 billion years ago. It may have formed in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, and drifted close to Earth since then. Bennu makes it closest approach to Earth every 6 years, coming within about 186,000 miles (299,000 kilometers) of our planet. Get the Facts This image shows a view across asteroid Bennu’s southern hemisphere and into space, and it demonstrates the number and distribution of boulders across Bennu’s surface. The image was obtained on March 7, 2019, by the PolyCam camera on NASA’s OSIRIS-REx spacecraft from a distance of about 3 miles (5 kilometers). The large, light-colored boulder in the center of the image is about 24 feet (7.4 meters) wide, which is roughly half the width of a basketball court.\nNASA Exploring Bennu\n\n## From: Solar_System\n from the core of a planetesimal, one of the building blocks of our solar system. The asteroid is most likely a survivor of multiple violent hit-and-run collisions, common when the solar system was forming. Thus, Psyche may be able to tell us how Earth’s core and the cores of the other rocky, or terrestrial, planets came to be.\nPsyche orbits the Sun between Mars and Jupiter at a distance ranging from 235 million to 309 million miles (378 million to 497 million kilometers) from the Sun. That’s 2.5 to 3.3 Astronomical Units (AU), with 1 AU being the distance between Earth and the Sun. Psyche takes about five Earth years to complete one orbit of the Sun, but it takes just over four hours to rotate once on its axis (a Psyche “day”). Exploration An artist's concept of the Psyche spacecraft.\nMaxar/ASU/P. Rubin/NASA/JPL-Caltech\nThis intriguing asteroid is now the primary target of NASA's Psyche mission. The Psyche spacecraft will launch in October 2023 and travel to the asteroid using solar-electric (low-thrust) propulsion, following a Mars flyby and a gravity assist.\nOnce in orbit, the spacecraft will map and study Psyche using a multispectral imager, a gamma-ray and neutron spectrometer, a magnetometer, and a radio instrument (for gravity measurement). The mission’s goal is, among other things, to determine whether Psyche is indeed the core of a planetesimal. How Psyche Got its Name Psyche was discovered by Italian astronomer Annibale de Gasparis on March 17, 1852. He named the asteroid for Psyche, the Greek goddess of the soul who was born mortal and married Eros (Roman Cupid), the god of Love.\nBecause it was the 16th asteroid to be\n\n## From: Solar_System\n Missions Artemis James Webb Space Telescope Hubble Space Telescope International Space Station OSIRIS-REx Humans in Space Why Go to Space Astronauts Commercial Space Destinations Spaceships and Rockets Living in Space Earth Explore Earth Science Climate Change Earth, Our Planet Earth Science in Action Earth Multimedia Earth Data Earth Science Researchers The Solar System The Sun Mercury Venus Earth The Moon Mars Jupiter Saturn Uranus Neptune Pluto & Dwarf Planets Asteroids, Comets & Meteors The Kuiper Belt The Oort Cloud Skywatching The Universe Exoplanets The Search for Life in the Universe Stars Galaxies Black Holes The Big Bang Dark Matter Dark Energy Science Earth Science Planetary Science Astrophysics & Space Science The Sun & Heliophysics Biological & Physical Sciences Lunar Science Citizen Science Astromaterials Aeronautics Research Human Space Travel Research Aeronautics Science in the Air NASA Aircraft Flight Innovation Supersonic Flight Air Traffic Solutions Green Aviation Tech Drones & You Technology Technology Transfer & Spinoffs Space Travel Technology Technology Living in Space Manufacturing and Materials Robotics Science Instruments Computing Learning Resources For Kids and Students For Educators For Colleges and Universities For Professionals Science for Everyone Requests for Exhibits, Artifacts, or Speakers STEM Engagement at NASA About NASA NASA's Impacts Centers and Facilities Directorates Organizations People of NASA Careers Internships Our History Doing Business with NASA Get Involved Contact NASA en Español Ciencia Aeronáutica Ciencias Terrestres Sistema Solar Universo News & Events Recently Published Video Series on NASA+ Podcasts Blogs Newsletters Social Media Media Resources Multimedia Images Videos on NASA+ Sounds and Ringtones Interactives NASA Apps Podcasts e-Books STEM Multimedia Highlights 2 min read Hubble Images a Peculiar Spiral article 2 days ago 6 min read NASA’s SPHEREx Space Telescope Begins Capturing Entire Sky article 3 days ago 4 min read NASA’s Chandra Diagnoses Cause of\n\n## From: Solar_System\n Suggested Searches Climate Change Artemis Expedition 64 Mars perseverance SpaceX Crew-2 International Space Station View All Topics A-Z Home Missions Humans in Space Earth The Solar System The Universe Science Aeronautics Technology Learning Resources About NASA Español News & Events Multimedia NASA+ Highlights 2 min readHubble Images a Peculiar Spiralarticle2 days ago 6 min readNASA’s Juno Mission Gets Under Jupiter’s and Io’s Surfacearticle5 days ago 6 min readWhat’s Up: May 2025 Skywatching Tips from NASAarticle3 days ago Back Missions Search All NASA Missions A to Z List of Missions Upcoming Launches and Landings Spaceships and Rockets Communicating with Missions Artemis James Webb Space Telescope Hubble Space Telescope International Space Station OSIRIS-REx Humans in Space Why Go to Space Astronauts Commercial Space Destinations Spaceships and Rockets Living in Space Earth Explore Earth Science Climate Change Earth, Our Planet Earth Science in Action Earth Multimedia Earth Data Earth Science Researchers The Solar System The Sun Mercury Venus Earth The Moon Mars Jupiter Saturn Uranus Neptune Pluto & Dwarf Planets Asteroids, Comets & Meteors The Kuiper Belt The Oort Cloud Skywatching The Universe Exoplanets The Search for Life in the Universe Stars Galaxies Black Holes The Big Bang Dark Matter Dark Energy Science Earth Science Planetary Science Astrophysics & Space Science The Sun & Heliophysics Biological & Physical Sciences Lunar Science Citizen Science Astromaterials Aeronautics Research Human Space Travel Research Aeronautics Science in the Air NASA Aircraft Flight Innovation Supersonic Flight Air Traffic Solutions Green Aviation Tech Drones & You Technology Technology Transfer & Spinoffs Space Travel Technology Technology Living in Space Manufacturing and Materials Robotics Science Instruments Computing Learning Resources For Kids and Students For Educators For Colleges and Universities For Professionals Science for Everyone Requests for Exhibits, Artifacts, or Speakers STEM Engagement at NASA About NASA NASA's Impacts Centers\n\n## From: Solar_System\n Exploration to FIRST Robotics 2025  article 5 days ago 5 min read NASA’s Lunar Drill Technology Passes Tests on the Moon article 5 days ago 2 min read NASA Technology Enables Leaps in Artificial Intelligence article 5 days ago Highlights 9 min read ARMD Research Solicitations (Updated May 1) article 3 days ago 3 min read NASA Invests in Future STEM Workforce Through Space Grant Awards  article 3 days ago 7 min read ¿Qué es una caminata espacial?

But Eros was important to astronomers as far back as 1898 when it became the first near-Earth asteroid (NEA) to be discovered.\nThe NEAR spacecraft first flew by Eros on Dec. 23, 1998, at a distance of about 2,400 miles (about 3,800 kilometers) and found that the asteroid was smaller than expected and had two medium-sized craters, a long surface ridge, and a density similar to that of Earth's crust. After several trajectory adjustments, NEAR finally moved into orbit around Eros on Valentine's Day (befitting an asteroid named for the Greek god of love), Feb. 14, 2000.\nAfter nearly a year in orbit, during which time the spacecraft was renamed \"NEAR Shoemaker\" in honor of astrogeology pioneer Eugene Shoemaker, the mission carried out humanity's first asteroid landing on Feb. 12, 2001. Eros was 196 million miles (315 million kilometers) from Earth at the time.\nThe spacecraft wasn't expected to survive the landing but its instruments remained operational, leading to yet another milestone. \"This is the first gamma-ray experiment that has ever been done on the surface of a body other than Earth,\" said Dr. Jacob Trombka of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. \"In fact, we can say it's the first feasibility study of how to design an instrument to be used on a rover that could select samples from the surface, look for the presence of water, or map the surface for the purpose of future mining.\"\nThe spacecraft issued its final transmission\n\n## From: Solar_System\nosphere, the enormous bubble of magnetism and ionized gas that the Sun emits. But it will take the spacecraft another 300 years to reach the inner \"edge\" of the Oort cloud and, at its current speed of a million miles a day, some 30,000 years more to finish passing through it.\nOccasionally, some gravitational influence-possibly from a passing star-nudges a comet loose from this incredibly vast and distant depository, and it falls toward the Sun. That is what must have happened to Siding Spring a few million years ago. It has been falling all this time toward the inner solar system, and it's going to give us just one shot at studying it. According to current estimates, its next visit will be in about 740,000 years. Discovery Discovered Jan. 3, 2013 at Siding Spring Observatory, Australia. How This Comet Got Its Name C/ indicates that it is a non-periodic comet. And 2013 A1 indicates that it was the first comet discovered in the first half of January 2013. Siding Spring is the name of the observatory where it was discovered.\nKeep Exploring Discover More Topics From NASA Sun Planets Asteroids, Comets & Meteors Kuiper Belt National Aeronautics and Space Administration NASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery.\n  * About NASA's Mission Join Us * Home * News & Events * Multimedia * NASA+ * Missions * Humans in Space * Earth * The Solar System * The Universe * Science * Aeronautics * Technology * Learning Resources * About NASA * NASA en Español Follow NASA More NASA Social Accounts NASA Newsletters Sitemap For Media Privacy Policy FOIA No FEAR Act Office of the IG Budget & Annual Reports Agency Financial Reports Contact NASA Accessibility Page Last Updated: \nNov 03, 2024 Page Editor: \nAMANDA BAR\n\n# Key Entities (LLM Graph)\n\n## ASTEROIDS (ASTEROID)\nCelestial bodies in the solar system, some of which have moons and rings.\n\n## 2024 YR4 (ASTEROID)\nA featured asteroid mentioned in the text.\n\n## PLANETARY DEFENSE COMMUNITY (ORGANIZATION)\nA community of experts that actively monitors asteroids, including 2024 YR4.\n\n## GROUND-BASED TELESCOPES (TELESCOPE)\nTelescopes located on Earth's surface that provided observational data on asteroid 2024 YR4, contributing to impact probability updates.\n\n## NASA SENTRY (SOFTWARE)\nA NASA system providing information on near-Earth objects such as 2024 YR4.\n\n## OSIRIS-APEX (SPACECRAFT)\nA NASA spacecraft redirected to study asteroid Apophis during its 2029 close Earth approach.\n\n## NASA'S GOLDSTONE SOLAR SYSTEM RADAR (TECHNOLOGY)\nObservational technology used to determine Psyche's composition and, combined with optical observations, to help generate 3D models of the asteroid.\n\n## EROS (ASTEROID)\nA featured asteroid mentioned in the text.\n\n# Key Relationships (LLM Graph)\n\n- EROS → Eros is described in the text as the son of Mercury in Greek mythology. → MERCURY (strength: 0.8)\n- EROS → Eros was used by astronomers to help calculate the mass of the Earth-moon system. → EARTH-MOON SYSTEM (strength: 0.8)\n- EROS → At the time of NEAR Shoemaker's landing, Eros was 196 million miles (315 million kilometers) from Earth. → EARTH (strength: 0.7)\n- EROS → Eros is described in the text as the son of Venus in Greek mythology. → VENUS (strength: 0.8)\n- EROS → Eros, as an S-type asteroid, is a common type found in the inner asteroid belt. → ASTEROID BELT (strength: 0.7)\n- EROS → Eros's orbit brings it well inside the orbit of Mars. → MARS (strength: 0.8)\n- EROS → Eros made a close approach to Earth in 1975. → EARTH (strength: 0.8)\n- EROS → Eros is a typical member of the Amors group of NEAs. → AMORS GROUP (strength: 0.9)\n- EROS → The asteroid Eros was named after Eros, son of the mythological figure Mercury. → MERCURY (strength: 0.7)\n- EROS → The asteroid Eros was found to have a density similar to that of Earth's crust. → EARTH'S CRUST (strength: 0.7)\n- EROS → Eros was used by astronomers to help calculate the value of the astronomical unit. → ASTRONOMICAL UNIT (strength: 0.8)\n- EROS → Eros is listed as a 'Featured Asteroid', an example of the Asteroids class. → ASTEROIDS (strength: 0.8)\n- PLANETARY DEFENSE COMMUNITY → The planetary defense community continues to monitor asteroid 2024 YR4. → 2024 YR4 (strength: 0.9)\n- GROUND-BASED TELESCOPES → Eros was observed with ground-based telescopes for a century. → EROS (strength: 0.9)\n- GROUND-BASED TELESCOPES → Data from ground-based telescopes, along with Webb, was used to update 2024 YR4's lunar impact probability. → 2024 YR4 (strength: 0.7)\n- ASTEROIDS → Asteroids can impact Mars due to its thin atmosphere. → MARS (strength: 0.7)\n- ASTEROIDS → Asteroids are typically trapped by Earth's gravity for a period. → EARTH (strength: 0.8)\n- 2024 YR4 → When discovered, asteroid 2024 YR4 was estimated to have a very small chance of impacting Earth on Dec. 22, 2032. → EARTH (strength: 0.7)\n- 2024 YR4 → 2024 YR4 is listed as a 'Featured Asteroid', an example of the Asteroids class. → ASTEROIDS (strength: 0.8)\n- 2024 YR4 → Asteroid 2024 YR4 was initially thought to have a very small chance of impacting Earth. → EARTH (strength: 0.7)\n- 2024 YR4 → After further observations, NASA concluded asteroid 2024 YR4 poses no significant impact risk to Earth in 2032 and beyond. → EARTH (strength: 0.8)\n- NASA SENTRY → NASA Sentry is a system that provides information on the asteroid 2024 YR4. → 2024 YR4 (strength: 0.9)\n\n# Related Entities (LLM Graph)\n\n- **MERCURY** (PLANET): A planet listed as a component under 'The Solar System' menu category.\n- **NEAR SHOEMAKER** (SPACECRAFT): Spacecraft, originally named NEAR, that first flew by Eros, then orbited and landed on it.

This technology could one day be used to deflect hazardous asteroids on a collision course with Earth.\nDART deliberately impacted Dimorphos on Sept. 26, 2022. NASA announced on Oct. 11, 2022,that analysis of data obtained by DART’s investigation team showed the spacecraft's kinetic impact with its target asteroid, the moonlet Dimorphos, successfully altered the smaller asteroid’s orbit . This marked the first time humanity had purposely changed the motion of a celestial object, and it was the first full-scale demonstration of asteroid deflection technology. Exploration Didymos – which means \"twin\n\n## From: Solar_System\n Dimorphos on Sept. 26, 2022, astronomers used telescopes on Earth to measure how much that time had changed. The investigation team confirmed the spacecraft’s impact altered Dimorphos’ orbit around Didymos by 32 minutes, shortening the 11-hour and 55-minute orbit to 11 hours and 23 minutes. (This measurement has a margin of uncertainty of approximately plus or minus 2 minutes.)\nBefore its encounter, NASA had defined a minimum successful orbit period change of Dimorphos as a change of 73 seconds or more. The early data showed DART surpassed this minimum benchmark by more than 25 times.\n“This result is one important step toward understanding the full effect of DART’s impact with its target asteroid,” said Lori Glaze, director of NASA’s Planetary Science Division at NASA Headquarters in Washington. “As new data come in each day, astronomers will be able to better assess whether, and how, a mission like DART could be used in the future to help protect Earth from a collision with an asteroid if we ever discover one headed our way.”\nThe investigation team is still acquiring data from ground-based observatories around the world – as well as with radar facilities at NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory’s Goldstone planetary radar in California and the National Science Foundation’s Green Bank Observatory in West Virginia. They are updating the period measurement with frequent observations to improve its precision.\nThe images of DART’s impact were streamed live back to Earth as the spacecraft plunged into Dimorphos. The camera was DART’s only onboard instrument. Called DRACO (Didymos Reconnaissance and Asteroid Camera for Optical navigation), the high-resolution imager was based on the New Horizons spacecraft’s LORRI instrument. Before impact, DRACO helped DART navigate to the Didymos system.\nDART also had a passenger – a small spacecraft\n\n## From: Solar_System\n had a passenger – a small spacecraft contributed by the Italian Space Agency (ASI). The shoebox-sized LICIACube (Light Italian CubeSat for Imaging of Asteroids) split apart from DART several days before DART’s impact with the moonlet. LICIACube captured images of the impact and material (ejecta) kicked up from the moonlet. An image captured by the Italian Space Agency’s LICIACube a few minutes after DART collided with Dimorphos on Sept. 26, 2022.\nASI/NASA Size and Distance Didymos, the larger asteroid of the binary pair (also called Didymos A) is about a half mile (780 meters) in diameter. The moonlet, Dimorphos (Didymos B), is about 525 feet (160 meters) in diameter.\nAs it orbits the Sun, the asteroid pair comes close to Earth's orbit, occasionally approaching relatively close to our planet. In 2003, it passed only 0.048 AU from Earth. (One astronomical unit, abbreviated as AU, is the distance from the Sun to Earth.) At its farthest, when Didymos is on the opposite side of the Sun from Earth, a bit beyond the orbit of Mars, it is about 3 AU away. Orbit and Rotation The orbit of Didymos ranges from just outside the orbit of Earth (about 1 AU) to a bit beyond the orbit of Mars (about 2.27 AU) and is slightly inclined with respect to the plane of the planets (called the ecliptic), by about 3 degrees. It takes 2.11 years to make each trip around the Sun.\nDidymos is classified as a member of the Amor group of asteroids, named after asteroid 1221 Amor.

        "expected_output": "The texts illustrate a progression in asteroid exploration. Initial stages involved discovery and remote observation from Earth, as seen with Apophis (discovered 19 June 2004, tracked closely by astronomers using Earth-based telescopes and radar like Goldstone and Green Bank in March 2021) and Didymos (discovered April 11, 1996, at Kitt Peak; its moon Dimorphos confirmed via radar and optical light curves in 2003). Vesta, discovered much earlier (Mar. 29, 1807), also represents early remote observation, though it was later visited by a spacecraft. The next stage involved spacecraft flybys and orbiting, enhancing remote sensing. Vesta was orbited by NASA's Dawn spacecraft from July 2011 to September 2012, allowing detailed study of its differentiated structure (crust, mantle, core) and surface features like the Rheasilvia crater. Eros, discovered in 1898, was the first NEA orbited (by NEAR Shoemaker starting Feb 14, 2000) and later landed upon (Feb 12, 2001), providing close-up imaging and surface composition data (gamma-ray experiment). More direct interaction includes kinetic impactors, exemplified by the DART mission intentionally colliding with Dimorphos on Sept 26, 2022, to test deflection technology. Finally, sample return represents the most direct analysis, achieved by OSIRIS-REx which collected samples from Bennu (not one of the listed examples, but mentioned elsewhere) and returned them to Earth in Sept 2023; NASA also plans to redirect the OSIRIS spacecraft (now OSIRIS-APEX) to study Apophis up close during its 2029 flyby, potentially using thrusters to stir up surface material.",

But Eros was important to astronomers as far back as 1898 when it became the first near-Earth asteroid (NEA) to be discovered.\nThe NEAR spacecraft first flew by Eros on Dec. 23, 1998, at a distance of about 2,400 miles (about 3,800 kilometers) and found that the asteroid was smaller than expected and had two medium-sized craters, a long surface ridge, and a density similar to that of Earth's crust. After several trajectory adjustments, NEAR finally moved into orbit around Eros on Valentine's Day (befitting an asteroid named for the Greek god of love), Feb. 14, 2000.\nAfter nearly a year in orbit, during which time the spacecraft was renamed \"NEAR Shoemaker\" in honor of astrogeology pioneer Eugene Shoemaker, the mission carried out humanity's first asteroid landing on Feb. 12, 2001. Eros was 196 million miles (315 million kilometers) from Earth at the time.\nThe spacecraft wasn't expected to survive the landing but its instruments remained operational, leading to yet another milestone. \"This is the first gamma-ray experiment that has ever been done on the surface of a body other than Earth,\" said Dr. Jacob Trombka of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. \"In fact, we can say it's the first feasibility study of how to design an instrument to be used on a rover that could select samples from the surface, look for the presence of water, or map the surface for the purpose of future mining.\"\nThe spacecraft issued its final transmission\n\n## From: Solar_System\n min read NASA Technology Enables Leaps in Artificial Intelligence article 5 days ago Highlights 9 min read ARMD Research Solicitations (Updated May 1) article 3 days ago 3 min read NASA Invests in Future STEM Workforce Through Space Grant Awards  article 3 days ago 7 min read ¿Qué es una caminata espacial?

It's a typical member of the Amors group of NEAs, which cross Mars' orbit but do not quite reach that of Earth. Unlike the much more numerous main-belt asteroids between Mars and Jupiter, NEAs are thought to be dead comets or fragments from main-belt asteroid collisions.\nEros was observed with ground-based telescopes for a century before our spacecraft gave us a close-up look, and was the subject of a worldwide observation campaign during its close approach to Earth in 1975 when it was only 14 million miles (22 million kilometers) away. Discovery 433 Eros was discovered on Aug. 13, 1898, by Gustav Witt, director of the Urania Observatory in Berlin, and independently on the same day by Auguste H.P. Charlois at Nice, France.\nWitt's discovery was the accidental byproduct of a two-hour photographic exposure he conducted of a different asteroid: 185 Eunike. Along with Eunike, the image he produced showed a 0.4-mm image trail, and observations on the following evening identified the object as one of unusually high apparent motion on the sky. Less than two weeks later, Adolf J. Berberich computed that the object's orbit brought it well inside the orbit of Mars, making it the first-known near-Earth asteroid.

This technology could one day be used to deflect hazardous asteroids on a collision course with Earth.\nDART deliberately impacted Dimorphos on Sept. 26, 2022. NASA announced on Oct. 11, 2022,that analysis of data obtained by DART’s investigation team showed the spacecraft's kinetic impact with its target asteroid, the moonlet Dimorphos, successfully altered the smaller asteroid’s orbit . This marked the first time humanity had purposely changed the motion of a celestial object, and it was the first full-scale demonstration of asteroid deflection technology.

Many more discoveries soon followed, with a couple of thousand KBOs being detected over the next quarter-century.\nThe first spacecraft to enter the Kuiper Belt region was NASA's Pioneer 10 spacecraft when it crossed into the space beyond Neptune's orbit in 1983. But the first spacecraft to visit an object in the Kuiper Belt was New Horizons when it flew by Pluto and its moons. New Horizons then went on to visit Arrokoth.\nTwo moons of the giant planets are thought to potentially be objects originally from the Kuiper Belt that became captured long ago. Neptune's largest moon Triton was visited by NASA's Voyager 2 spacecraft in 1989, while Phoebe, a small outer moon of Saturn, was visited by NASA's Cassini spacecraft in 2004. Both of these potential captured Kuiper Belt objects orbit their planets in a direction opposite of the other moons and the planet's rotation, which is a strong indication that they likely were captured objects that strayed too close to the planets.

When frozen, they are the size of a small town. When a comet's orbit brings it close to the Sun, it heats up and spews dust and gases into a giant glowing head larger than most planets. The dust and gases form a tail that stretches away from the Sun for millions of miles. There are likely billions of comets orbiting our Sun in the Kuiper Belt and even more distant Oort Cloud.

Debris from comet Swift-Tuttle creates the Perseids. \nNASA/Preston Dyches Discovery Comet Swift-Tuttle was discovered in 1862 independently by both Lewis Swift and Horace Tuttle. Overview Comet 109P/Swift-Tuttle takes 133 years to orbit the Sun once. Swift-Tuttle last reached perihelion (closest approach to the Sun) in 1992 and will return again in 2125.\nSwift-Tuttle is a large comet – its nucleus is 16 miles (26 kilometers) across. (That is more than twice the size of the object hypothesized to have led the demise of the dinosaurs.)\nThe pieces of space debris that interact with our atmosphere to create the popular Perseids meteor shower originate from Swift-Tuttle. This annual meteor shower takes place each August, and peaks mid-month. It was Giovanni Schiaparelli who realized in 1865 that this comet was the source of the Perseids.\nWhen comets come around the Sun, the dust they emit gradually spreads into a dusty trail around their orbits. Every year the Earth passes through these debris trails, which allows the\n\n## From: Solar_System\n around a visual magnitude of -4). They may exhibit larger explosions of light and color and can persist longer than an average meteor streak. This is due to the fact that fireballs originate from larger particles of cometary material. Oftentimes, this particular shower exhibits fireballs on or around Halloween, making them known as the Halloween Fireballs.\nComet Encke approached the sun for its close encounter in 2013 at the same time as the much talked about and imaged comet ISON, and because of this was imaged by both the MESSENGER and STEREO spacecraft.

It was taken as the spacecraft flew by at a distance of about 435 miles (700 kilometers). Jets can be seen streaming out of the nucleus.\nNASA/JPL-Caltech/UMD Discovery Hartley 2 was discovered by Malcolm Hartley on March 15, 1986 using the Schmidt Telescope at the Siding Spring Observatory in Australia. Overview Comet 103P/Hartley (Hartley 2) is a small, oval (or peanut) shaped comet – its nucleus measures approximately one mile (1.6 kilometers) in diameter. It takes Hartley 2 about 6.47 years to orbit the Sun once. Hartley 2 last reached perihelion (closest approach to the Sun) in 2017.\nHartley 2 orbits the Sun within the asteroid belt, which lies between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Hartley 2 is a Jupiter-family comet. A Jupiter-family comet is defined as having an orbital period of less than 20 years and one that has been modified by close passages with the gas giant.\nOne spacecraft has encountered this comet: Deep Impact (EPOXI) in 2010. During its flyby, the spacecraft came within 431 miles (694 kilometers) of the comet. Hartley 2 was the fifth comet to be visited by spacecraft and was the second encounter made by this particular spacecraft. Deep Impact had previously visited comet 9P/Tempel 1 in 2005.\nCalled hyperactive by the EPOXI mission, comet Hartley 2 spins around one axis, while tumbling around another one. Comet Hartley's core is also not uniform, but is made up of water ice with methanol, carbon dioxide and possibly ethane. The release of these gases occur at different locations on the\n\n## From: Solar_System\n to deduce the composition and structure of the comet. The collision also left dust floating on the top of Jupiter's clouds. By watching the dust spread across the planet, scientists were able to track high-altitude winds on Jupiter for the first time. And by comparing changes in the magnetosphere with changes in the atmosphere following the impact, scientists were able to study the relationship between them.\nScientists have calculated that the comet was originally about 0.9 to 1.2 miles (1.5 to 2 kilometers) wide. If a similar-sized object were to hit Earth, it would be devastating. The impact might send dust and debris into the sky, creating a haze that would cool the atmosphere and absorb sunlight, enveloping the entire planet in darkness. If the haze lasted long enough, plant life would die – along with the people and animals that depend on it to survive.\nThese kinds of collisions were more frequent in the early solar system. In fact, comet impacts were probably the main way that elements other than hydrogen and helium got to Jupiter. Today, impacts of this size probably occur only every few centuries. How This Comet Got Its Name The comet was named for its discoverers. Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 was the ninth short-periodic comet discovered by Eugene and Carolyn Shoemaker and David Levy.\nKeep Exploring Discover More Topics From NASA Sun Planets Asteroids, Comets & Meteors Kuiper Belt National Aeronautics and Space Administration NASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery.\n  * About NASA's Mission Join Us * Home * News & Events * Multimedia * NASA+ * Missions * Humans in Space * Earth * The Solar System * The Universe * Science * Aeronautics * Technology * Learning Resources * About NASA * NASA en Español Follow NASA More NASA Social Accounts NASA Newsletters Sitemap For Media Privacy Policy FOIA\n\n# Key Entities (LLM Graph)\n\n## HALLEY (CELESTIAL_OBJECT)\nA specific comet (likely Halley's Comet) listed under 'Featured Comets'.\n\n## SWIFT-TUTTLE (CELESTIAL_OBJECT)\nA specific comet listed under 'Featured Comets'.\n\n## COMET HARTLEY 2 (CELESTIAL_OBJECT)\nAlso known as Comet 103P/Hartley.

Overview 81P/Wild (Wild 2) (Wild is pronounced vilt) is a small comet with the shape of a flattened sphere and measures about 1.03 x 1.24 x 1.71 miles (1.65 x 2 x 2.75 kilometers). It takes Wild 2 nearly six and a half years (6.41) to orbit the Sun once. Wild 2 last reached perihelion (closest approach to the Sun) in 2016.\nComet Wild 2 is known as a fresh periodic comet. Wild 2 orbits the Sun between Mars and Jupiter, but it did not always travel the course of its orbit here. Originally, this comet's orbit lay between that of Uranus and Jupiter. On Sept. 10, 1974, gravitational interactions between this comet and the planet Jupiter pulled the comet's orbit into a new shape\n\n## From: Solar_System\n mostly due to gravitational encounters with Jupiter. Thus, it's conceivable that Comet 2I/Borisov might also have been ejected from its home in a similar manner. Surface We have no direct observations of Comet 2I/Borisov's surface, but comets from our own planetary system have rough surfaces coated in places with smooth blankets of icy, dusty debris. Atmosphere Comet 2I/Borisov is too small to hold onto its own atmosphere — it doesn't have enough material (or mass), and thus not enough gravity. However, like most comets that venture closer to the Sun than Jupiter's orbit, Comet 2I/Borisov developed a coma — a dust-filled cloud of gas around the comet's nucleus, created when ices are warmed by solar heating and loft fine dust off the comet's surface and into space.\nKeep Exploring Discover More Topics From NASA Sun Planets Asteroids, Comets & Meteors Kuiper Belt National Aeronautics and Space Administration NASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery.\n  * About NASA's Mission Join Us * Home * News & Events * Multimedia * NASA+ * Missions * Humans in Space * Earth * The Solar System * The Universe * Science * Aeronautics * Technology * Learning Resources * About NASA * NASA en Español Follow NASA More NASA Social Accounts NASA Newsletters Sitemap For Media Privacy Policy FOIA No FEAR Act Office of the IG Budget & Annual Reports Agency Financial Reports Contact NASA Accessibility Page Last Updated: \nNov 03, 2024 Page Editor: \nAMANDA BARNETT Responsible NASA Official for Science: \nDana Bolles\n\n* Explore Search * News & Events ### News & Events * Recently Published * Video Series on NASA+ * Podcasts * Blogs * Newsletters * Social Media * Media Resources * Multimedia ### Multimedia\n\n## From: Solar_System\n's controlled impact on the comet's surface on Sept. 30, 2016.\nChuryumov-Gerasimenko loops around the Sun in an orbit that crosses those of Jupiter and Mars, approaching but not reaching Earth's orbit. Like most Jupiter Family comets, it is thought to have fallen from the Kuiper Belt, a region beyond Neptune's orbit, as a result of one or more collisions or gravitational tugs.\nAnalysis of the comet's orbital evolution indicates that until the mid-19th century, the closest it got to the Sun was 4.0 AU (about 373 million miles or 600 million kilometers), which is roughly two-thirds of the way from Mars' orbit to that of Jupiter. That far from the Sun's heat, it would not sprout a coma or tails, so it was invisible from Earth.\nBut scientists calculate that in 1840, a fairly close encounter with Jupiter must have sent the comet flying deeper into the inner solar system, down to about 3.0 AU (about 280 million miles or 450 million kilometers) from the Sun. Churyumov-Gerasimenko's perihelion (closest approach to the Sun) drifted a bit closer to the Sun over the next century, and then Jupiter gave the comet another gravitational kick in 1959. Since then, the comet's perihelion has stood at about 1.3 AU, which is about 27 million miles (43 million kilometers) outside Earth's orbit.\nThe comet's nucleus is thought to be quite porous, giving it a density much lower than that of water. When heated by the Sun, it is thought to emit about twice as much dust as gas.\nBesides collecting a vast amount of data on the properties of the comet, including its interior, surface, and the surrounding gas, dust, and plasma, Rosetta’s key findings included the discovery of water vapor in the comet that is significantly different from that found on Earth,\n\n## From: Solar_System\n comet's orbit into a new shape. Paul Wild discovered this comet during its first revolution of the Sun on the new orbit.\nSince Wild 2 is a fresh comet (it has not had as many orbits around the Sun at close quarters) it is an ideal specimen for discovering more about the early solar system.\nNASA made use of this special comet, when in 2004 it sent the Stardust mission to fly by it and gather particles—the first such gathering of extraterrestrial materials from beyond the orbit of the moon. These samples were gathered in an aerogel collector as the spacecraft flew within 236 kilometers (147 miles) of the comet. The samples were then returned to Earth in an Apollo-like capsule in 2006. In those samples, scientists discovered glycine: a fundamental building block of life. How This Comet Got Its Name Comets are usually named for their discoverer(s) or for the name of the observatory/telescope used in the discovery. Since Paul Wild discovered this comet it is named for him. The letter \"P\" indicates that 81P/Wild (Wild 2) is a \"periodic\" comet. Periodic comets have an orbital period of less than 200 years.\nKeep Exploring Discover More Topics From NASA Sun Planets Asteroids, Comets & Meteors Kuiper Belt National Aeronautics and Space Administration NASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery.\n  * About NASA's Mission Join Us * Home * News & Events * Multimedia * NASA+ * Missions * Humans in Space * Earth * The Solar System * The Universe * Science * Aeronautics * Technology * Learning Resources * About NASA * NASA en Español Follow NASA More NASA Social Accounts NASA Newsletters Sitemap For Media Privacy Policy FOIA No FEAR Act Office of the IG Budget & Annual Reports Agency Financial Reports Contact NASA Accessibility Page Last Updated\n\n## From: Solar_System\n a single body at the time) had made a close approach to Jupiter in July 1992 and had been torn apart by tidal forces resulting from the planet's powerful gravity. The comet was thought to have been orbiting Jupiter for about a decade before its demise.\nThe disruption of a comet into multiple fragments was rare, and observing a captured comet in orbit about Jupiter was even more unusual, but the biggest and rarest revelation was that the fragments were going to smash into Jupiter.\nNASA had spacecraft in position to watch – for the first time in history – a collision between two bodies in the solar system. NASA's Galileo orbiter (then still en route to Jupiter) captured unprecedented direct views as the string of fragments labeled A through W smashed into Jupiter's cloud tops. The impacts started on July 16, 1994, and ended on July 22, 1994. These images of Jupiter show the luminous night-side impact of fragment W of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9. The images were taken by the Galileo spacecraft on July 22, 1994. \nNASA/JPL-Caltech/Galileo Imaging Team\nMany Earth-based observatories and orbiting spacecraft including Hubble Space Telescope, Ulysses, and Voyager 2 also studied the impact and its aftermath.\nThe \"freight train\" of fragments smashed into Jupiter with the force of 300 million atomic bombs. The fragments created huge plumes that were 1,200 to 1,900 miles (2,000 to 3,000 kilometers) high and heated the atmosphere to temperatures as hot as 53,000 to 71,000 degrees Fahrenheit (30,000 to 40,000 degrees Celsius). Shoemaker-Levy 9 left dark, ringed scars that were eventually erased by Jupiter's winds.\nWhile the impact was dramatic, it was more than a show. It gave scientists an opportunity to gain new insights into Jupiter, Shoemaker-Levy 9, and cosmic collisions in general. Researchers were able to deduce the composition and structure\n\n## From: Solar_System\n. Such collisions were likely much more common billions of years ago when most KBOs were on similar orbits that were more circular and close to the plane of the planets (called the ecliptic). Today such collisions are much rarer. They also tend to be destructive, since lots of KBOs are on now orbits that are tilted or elliptical, meaning they crash into each other with greater force and break apart. Relationship to Comets The Kuiper Belt is a source of comets, but not the only source. Today the Kuiper Belt is thought to be very slowly eroding itself away. Objects there occasionally collide, with the collisional fragments producing smaller KBOs (some of which may become comets), as well as dust that's blown out of the solar system by the solar wind. Pieces produced by colliding KBOs can be pushed by Neptune's gravity into orbits that send them sunward, where Jupiter further corrals them into short loops lasting 20 years or less. These are called short-period Jupiter-family comets. Given their frequent trips into the inner solar system, most tend to exhaust their volatile ices fairly quickly and eventually become dormant, or dead, comets with little or no detectable activity.\nResearchers have found that some near-Earth asteroids are actually burned-out comets, and most of them would have started out in the Kuiper Belt. Many comets crash into the Sun or the planets. Those that have close encounters with Jupiter tend to be ripped apart or tossed out of the solar system entirely.\nThe other source of comets is the Oort Cloud, where most long-period comets on highly tilted orbits come from.\nKeep Exploring Discover More Topics From NASA Sun Planets Asteroids, Comets & Meteors Kuiper Belt National Aeronautics and Space Administration NASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through\n\n## From: Solar_System\n to deduce the composition and structure of the comet. The collision also left dust floating on the top of Jupiter's clouds. By watching the dust spread across the planet, scientists were able to track high-altitude winds on Jupiter for the first time. And by comparing changes in the magnetosphere with changes in the atmosphere following the impact, scientists were able to study the relationship between them.\nScientists have calculated that the comet was originally about 0.9 to 1.2 miles (1.5 to 2 kilometers) wide. If a similar-sized object were to hit Earth, it would be devastating. The impact might send dust and debris into the sky, creating a haze that would cool the atmosphere and absorb sunlight, enveloping the entire planet in darkness. If the haze lasted long enough, plant life would die – along with the people and animals that depend on it to survive.\nThese kinds of collisions were more frequent in the early solar system. In fact, comet impacts were probably the main way that elements other than hydrogen and helium got to Jupiter. Today, impacts of this size probably occur only every few centuries. How This Comet Got Its Name The comet was named for its discoverers.

The collision also left dust floating on the top of Jupiter's clouds. By watching the dust spread across the planet, scientists were able to track high-altitude winds on Jupiter for the first time. And by comparing changes in the magnetosphere with changes in the atmosphere following the impact, scientists were able to study the relationship between them.\nScientists have calculated that the comet was originally about 0.9 to 1.2 miles (1.5 to 2 kilometers) wide. If a similar-sized object were to hit Earth, it would be devastating. The impact might send dust and debris into the sky, creating a haze that would cool the atmosphere and absorb sunlight, enveloping the entire planet in darkness. If the haze lasted long enough, plant life would die – along with the people and animals that depend on it to survive.\nThese kinds of collisions were more frequent in the early solar system. In fact, comet impacts were probably the main way that elements other than hydrogen and helium got to Jupiter. Today, impacts of this size probably occur only every few centuries. How This Comet Got Its Name The comet was named for its discoverers. Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 was the ninth short-periodic comet discovered by Eugene and Carolyn Shoemaker and David Levy.\nKeep Exploring Discover More Topics From NASA Sun Planets Asteroids, Comets & Meteors Kuiper Belt National Aeronautics and Space Administration NASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery.\n  * About NASA's Mission Join Us * Home * News & Events * Multimedia * NASA+ * Missions * Humans in Space * Earth * The Solar System * The Universe * Science * Aeronautics * Technology * Learning Resources * About NASA * NASA en Español Follow NASA More NASA Social Accounts NASA Newsletters Sitemap For Media Privacy Policy FOIA\n\n## From: Solar_System\n and the International Space Station observed and detected Comet ISON on the final stretch of its multi-million year journey from the Oort Cloud to the solar corona.\nUnable to render the provided source Discovery Russian astronomers Vitali Nevski and Artyom Novichonok discovered the comet with the International Scientific Optical Network 0.4 meter telescope in Kislovodsk, Russia. How This Comet Got Its Name C/2012 S1 (ISON) bears the name of the night-sky survey program that discovered it, the International Scientific Optical Network. ISON is a group of observatories in 10 countries which have organized to detect, monitor, and track objects in space. The network is managed by the Keldysh Institute of Applied Mathematics, part of the Russian Academy of Sciences.\nThe official International Astronomical Union name of the comet is C/2012 S1 (ISON). Here's how the name breaks down:\n  * C indicated ISON it was not expected to return to the inner solar system (even if it had survived its close brush with the Sun's atmosphere in November 2013). Comets that are regular visitors such as comet Halley are designated with P for periodic comets, meaning its orbital period is less than 200 years.\n  * 2012 marks the year of discovery.\n  * S designates the half month it was discovered in (last half of September).\n  * 1 means it was the first discovered in that period.

But it will take the spacecraft another 300 years to reach the inner \"edge\" of the Oort cloud and, at its current speed of a million miles a day, some 30,000 years more to finish passing through it.\nOccasionally, some gravitational influence-possibly from a passing star-nudges a comet loose from this incredibly vast and distant depository, and it falls toward the Sun. That is what must have happened to Siding Spring a few million years ago. It has been falling all this time toward the inner solar system, and it's going to give us just one shot at studying it. According to current estimates, its next visit will be in about 740,000 years. Discovery Discovered Jan. 3, 2013 at Siding Spring Observatory, Australia.

This is due to the fact that fireballs originate from larger particles of cometary material. Oftentimes, this particular shower exhibits fireballs on or around Halloween, making them known as the Halloween Fireballs.\nComet Encke approached the sun for its close encounter in 2013 at the same time as the much talked about and imaged comet ISON, and because of this was imaged by both the MESSENGER and STEREO spacecraft.

When frozen, they are the size of a small town. When a comet's orbit brings it close to the Sun, it heats up and spews dust and gases into a giant glowing head larger than most planets. The dust and gases form a tail that stretches away from the Sun for millions of miles. There are likely billions of comets orbiting our Sun in the Kuiper Belt and even more distant Oort Cloud.

        "expected_output": "The first Kuiper Belt Object (KBO) discovered was Pluto in 1930, though it wasn't initially recognized as part of a larger population due to its size and brightness relative to later discoveries and the lack of expectation for such a belt. Gerard Kuiper speculated about objects beyond Pluto in 1951, lending his name to the region (sometimes also called the Edgeworth-Kuiper Belt). Kenneth Edgeworth also mentioned such objects in the 1940s. Significant progress occurred in 1992 when David Jewitt and Jane Luu used a large telescope on Mauna Kea equipped with a CCD camera to discover the second KBO, 1992 QB1 (later named Albion). This technological advancement opened the door to finding thousands more KBOs. The first spacecraft to enter the region was Pioneer 10 in 1983, crossing beyond Neptune's orbit. However, NASA's New Horizons was the first mission to visit a KBO, flying past Pluto and its moons in July 2015. It then performed the most distant flyby in history, visiting the KBO Arrokoth (discovered in 2014 using the Hubble Space Telescope) on January 1, 2019, revealing it to be a contact binary and the most primitive object explored by spacecraft.",
        "retrieval_context": "# Relevant Information from Source Documents (LLM Graph)\n\n## From: Solar_System\n David Jewitt and Jane Luu attached a CCD camera to a large (2.2-meter) telescope on Mauna Kea in Hawaii, and they quickly detected an object, which was designated 1992 QB1, and later named Albion. Many more discoveries soon followed, with a couple of thousand KBOs being detected over the next quarter-century.\nThe first spacecraft to enter the Kuiper Belt region was NASA's Pioneer 10 spacecraft when it crossed into the space beyond Neptune's orbit in 1983. But the first spacecraft to visit an object in the Kuiper Belt was New Horizons when it flew by Pluto and its moons. New Horizons then went on to visit Arrokoth.\nTwo moons of the giant planets are thought to potentially be objects originally from the Kuiper Belt that became captured long ago. Neptune's largest moon Triton was visited by NASA's Voyager 2 spacecraft in 1989, while Phoebe, a small outer moon of Saturn, was visited by NASA's Cassini spacecraft in 2004. Both of these potential captured Kuiper Belt objects orbit their planets in a direction opposite of the other moons and the planet's rotation, which is a strong indication that they likely were captured objects that strayed too close to the planets.

        "expected_output": "Neptune's gravity and early migration are thought to be primary factors in shaping the Kuiper Belt's structure. The shifting orbits of the giant planets, particularly Neptune moving outward, stirred the primordial disk of icy bodies. Neptune's gravity scattered many objects, slingshotting some into the Oort Cloud or out of the solar system, while forcing others into the current Kuiper Belt region. This gravitational influence created distinct populations: Classical KBOs, residing mainly between 40-50 AU, are divided into 'cold' and 'hot' populations based on their orbits. Cold classicals have nearly circular, low-inclination orbits, suggesting they remained largely unperturbed by Neptune. Hot classicals have more elliptical and inclined orbits due to past gravitational interactions with Neptune that 'heated' or energized their orbits. Resonant KBOs are locked in stable orbital patterns with Neptune (e.g., 3:2 resonance). Pluto is a prime example, belonging to the 'plutinos' subgroup within the 3:2 resonance, which protects them from close encounters despite crossing Neptune's orbit path. The Scattered Disk extends far beyond the main belt, containing objects Neptune scattered into highly elliptical and inclined orbits, some reaching hundreds of AU from the Sun. These objects, along with Centaurs (scattered inward), represent bodies significantly perturbed by Neptune's gravity.",
        "retrieval_context": "# Relevant Information from Source Documents (LLM Graph)\n\n## From: Solar_System\n the Sun, while the hot ones wander over a larger range of distances from the Sun (meaning, in some parts of their orbits, they are closer to the Sun and sometimes they are farther away).\nThe differences between these two types of bodies in the classical Kuiper Belt have everything to do with Neptune. The cold classical KBOs have orbits that never come very close to Neptune, and thus they remain \"cool\" and unperturbed by the giant planet's gravity. Their orbits likely haven't moved much for billions of years. In contrast, the hot classical KBOs have had interactions with Neptune in the past (that is, with the giant planet's gravity). These interactions pumped energy into their orbits, which stretched them into an elliptical shape, and tilted them slightly out of the plane of the planets. Resonant KBOs A significant number of KBOs are in orbits that are tightly controlled by Neptune. They orbit in resonance with the giant planet, meaning their orbits are in a stable, repeating pattern with Neptune's. These resonant KBOs complete a specific number of orbits in the same amount of time that Neptune completes a specific number of orbits (in other words, a ratio). There are several of these groupings, or resonances – 1:1 (pronounced \"one to one\"), 4:3, 3:2, and 2:1. For example, Pluto is in a 3:2 resonance with Neptune, meaning it circles the Sun twice for every three times Neptune goes around.\nIn fact, there are enough objects on orbits with this 3:2 resonance, along with Pluto, that astronomers have given them their own category among the resonant KBOs: the plutinos. Scattered Disk The scattered disk is a region that stretches far beyond the main part of the Kuiper Belt. It is home to objects that have been scattered by Neptune into orbits that are highly elliptical and highly inclined to the plane of the\n\n## From: Solar_System\n the early surprises was that KBOs could be grouped according to the shapes and sizes of their orbits. This led scientists to understand that there are several distinct groupings, or populations, of these objects whose orbits provide clues about their history. Which category an object belongs to has a lot to do with how it has interacted with the gravity of Neptune over time.\nMost of the objects in the Kuiper Belt are found in the main part of the belt itself or in the scattered disk: Classical KBOs A large fraction of KBOs orbit the Sun in what's called the classical Kuiper Belt. The term \"classical\" refers to the fact that, among the KBOs, these objects have orbits most similar to the original, or classical, idea of what the Kuiper Belt was expected to be like before astronomers started actually finding objects there. (The expectation was that, if there were objects beyond Neptune, they would be in relatively circular orbits that aren't tilted too much from the plane of the planets. Instead, many KBOs are found to have significantly elliptical and tilted orbits. Thus, to some extent, the classification of KBOs still reflects our evolving understanding of this distant region of the solar system.)\nThere are two main groups of objects in the classical Kuiper Belt, referred to as \"cold\" and \"hot.\" These terms don't refer to temperature – instead, they describe the orbits of the objects, along with the amount of influence Neptune's gravity has had on them.\nAll classical KBOs have a similar average distance from the Sun between about 40 and 50 AU. Cold classical KBOs have relatively circular orbits that are not tilted much away from the plane of the planets; hot classical KBOs have more elliptical and tilted orbits (which astronomers refer to as eccentric and inclined, respectively). This means the cold variety spend most of their time at about the same distance from the Sun, while the hot ones\n\n## From: Solar_System\n into a large planet.\nThe amount of material in the Kuiper Belt today might be just a small fraction of what was originally there. According to one well-supported theory, the shifting orbits of the four giant planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) could have caused most of the original material – likely 7 to 10 times the mass of Earth – to be lost.\nThe basic idea is that early in the solar system's history, Uranus and Neptune were forced to orbit farther from the Sun due to shifts in the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn. As Uranus and Neptune drifted farther outward, they passed through the dense disk of small, icy bodies left over after the giant planets formed. Neptune's orbit was the farthest out, and its gravity bent the paths of countless icy bodies inward toward the other giants. Jupiter ultimately slingshotted most of these icy bodies either into extremely distant orbits (to form the Oort Cloud) or out of the solar system entirely. As Neptune tossed icy objects sunward, this caused its own orbit to drift even farther out, and its gravitational influence forced the remaining icy objects into the range of locations where we find them in the Kuiper Belt.\nToday the Kuiper Belt is slowly eroding away. Objects that remain there occasionally collide, producing smaller objects fragmented by the collision, sometimes comets and also dust that's blown out of the solar system by the solar wind. Structure and Characteristics The Kuiper Belt is an enormous, donut-shaped volume of space in the outer solar system. While there are many icy bodies in this region that we broadly refer to as Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs) or trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs), they're fairly diverse in size, shape, and color. And importantly, they're not evenly distributed through space – once astronomers started discovering them in the early 1990s, one of the early surprises was that KBO\n\n## From: Solar_System\n highly inclined to the plane of the planets. Many scattered disk objects have orbits that are tilted by tens of degrees. Some venture hundreds of AU from the Sun and high above the plane of the planets at the farthest point in their orbits, before falling back to a closest point near the orbit of Neptune. The orbits of many objects in the scattered disk are still slowly evolving, with objects here being lost over time, compared to the classical Kuiper Belt, where orbits are more stable.\nThe scattered disk gives the donut-shaped classical Kuiper Belt a much wider and thicker extent. Some astronomers talk about the two as separate regions, although their boundaries overlap and are linked together in a number of ways. In particular, the objects in both regions are thought to have ended up there as a result of the migration of Neptune from its original, closer orbit to where it is now. Eris is an example of an object in the scattered disk and is the largest known member of this population. Additional Families Most of the objects in the Kuiper Belt are found in the main part of the belt or in the scattered disk, but there are also a couple of additional families of objects that orbit the Sun interior and exterior to the belt. These additional groups of objects probably came from the Kuiper Belt originally, but have been pulled out of the main regions by the gravity of Neptune or perhaps by another massive planet. Detached Objects Detached Kuiper Belt objects have orbits that never come closer to the Sun than about 40 AU. This sets them apart from most other KBOs, which spend at least part of their orbits in the region between 40 and 50 AU from the Sun. Because their orbits don't come close to Neptune's distance from the Sun (~30 AU), detached objects seem unlikely to have been pulled out of the Kuiper Belt by interactions with the giant planet. Scientists think it's likely some other force is responsible, such as an undiscovered giant planet (\n\n## From: Solar_System\n Belt objects, or KBOs, against a background of stars in the constellation Sagittarius. The two KBOs are roughly 4 billion miles from Earth.\nNASA, ESA, SwRI, JHU/APL, New Horizons KBO Search Team Size and Distance The Kuiper Belt is one of the largest structures in our solar system – others being the Oort Cloud, the heliosphere, and the magnetosphere of Jupiter. Its overall shape is like a puffed-up disk or donut. Its inner edge begins at the orbit of Neptune, at about 30 AU from the Sun. (1 AU, or astronomical unit, is the distance from Earth to the Sun.) The inner, main region of the Kuiper Belt ends around 50 AU from the Sun. Overlapping the outer edge of the main part of the Kuiper Belt is a second region called the scattered disk, which continues outward to nearly 1,000 AU, with some bodies on orbits that go even farther beyond.\nSo far, more than 2,000 trans-Neptunian objects have been cataloged by observers, representing only a tiny fraction of the total number of objects scientists think are out there. In fact, astronomers estimate there are hundreds of thousands of objects in the region that are larger than 60 miles (100 kilometers) wide or larger. However, the total mass of all the material in the Kuiper Belt is estimated to be no more than about 10% of the mass of Earth. Formation and Origins Astronomers think the icy objects of the Kuiper Belt are remnants left over from the formation of the solar system. Similar to the relationship between the main asteroid belt and Jupiter, it's a region of objects that might have come together to form a planet had Neptune not been there. Instead, Neptune's gravity stirred up this region of space so much that the small, icy objects there weren't able to coalesce into a large planet.\nThe\n\n## From: Solar_System\n. Astronomers think there are millions of small, icy objects in this region – including hundreds of thousands that are larger than 60 miles (100 kilometers) wide. Some of the objects, including Pluto, are over 600 miles (1,000 kilometers) wide. In addition to rock and water ice, objects in the Kuiper Belt also contain a variety of other frozen compounds like ammonia and methane.\nSimilar to the asteroid belt, the Kuiper Belt is a region of leftovers from the solar system's early history. Like the asteroid belt, it has also been shaped by a giant planet, although it's more of a thick disk (like a donut) than a thin belt.\nThe Kuiper Belt shouldn't be confused with the Oort Cloud, which is a much more distant region of icy, comet-like bodies that surrounds the solar system, including the Kuiper Belt. Both the Oort Cloud and the Kuiper Belt are thought to be sources of comets.\nThe Kuiper Belt is truly a frontier in space – it's a place we're still just beginning to explore and our understanding is still evolving. Namesake The region is named for astronomer Gerard Kuiper, who published a scientific paper in 1951 that speculated about objects beyond Pluto. Astronomer Kenneth Edgeworth also mentioned objects beyond Pluto in papers he published in the 1940s, and thus it's sometimes referred to as the Edgeworth-Kuiper Belt. Some researchers prefer to call it the Trans-Neptunian Region, and refer to Kuiper Belt objects (KBOs) as trans-Neptunian objects, or TNOs.\nWhatever your preferred term is, the belt occupies an enormous volume in our solar system, and the small worlds that inhabit it have a lot to tell us about early history. These two multiple-exposure images from NASA's Hubble Space Telescope show Kuiper Belt objects, or KBOs\n\n## From: Solar_System\n as an undiscovered giant planet (in a very distant orbit), the gravity of passing stars, or gravitational perturbations as the Kuiper Belt was forming long ago.\nSedna is an example of a detached KBO. The closest it comes to the Sun is 76 AU, while at its farthest it travels out to ~1200 AU. Centaurs Centaurs are objects with orbits that travel through the space between the orbits of Jupiter and Neptune. Objects in these orbits interact strongly with the gravity of the giant planets. Because of these powerful gravitational encounters, most are fated to either be ejected from the solar system or pushed into the inner solar system where they become comets or crash into the Sun and planets.\nThis process – the removal of the Centaurs – is ongoing, taking tens of millions of years for the typical Centaur object. Thus, the fact that there are Centaurs around today is evidence that they're being actively supplied from somewhere else. Astronomers think the most likely explanation is that they're relatively recent escapees from the Kuiper Belt. In fact, Centaurs are understood to be scattered objects, like those in the scattered disk – the difference being that the Centaurs have been scattered closer to the Sun by Neptune, rather than farther out. Pluto's Place in the Kuiper Belt In 1930, Pluto became the first Kuiper Belt object to be discovered. It was found at a time before astronomers had reason to expect a large population of icy worlds beyond Neptune. Today it's known as the \"King of the Kuiper Belt\" – and it's the largest object in the region, even though another object similar in size, called Eris, has a slightly higher mass.

Strong east-west winds moving in opposite directions separate the bands. Juno previously discovered that these winds, or jet streams, reach depths of about 2,000 miles (roughly 3,200 kilometers). Researchers are still trying to solve the mystery of how the jet streams form. Data collected by Juno during multiple passes reveal one possible clue: that the atmosphere’s ammonia gas travels up and down in remarkable alignment with the observed jet streams.\nJuno’s data also shows that the belts and zones undergo a transition around 40 miles (65 kilometers) beneath Jupiter’s water clouds. At shallow depths, Jupiter’s belts are brighter in microwave light than the neighboring zones. But at deeper levels, below the water clouds, the opposite is true – which reveals a similarity to our oceans. Polar Cyclones Juno previously discovered polygonal arrangements of giant cyclonic storms at both of Jupiter’s poles – eight arranged in an octagonal pattern in the north and five arranged in a pentagonal pattern in the south. Over time, mission scientists determined these atmospheric phenomena are extremely resilient, remaining in the same location.\nJuno data also indicates that, like hurricanes on Earth, these cyclones want to move poleward, but cyclones located at the center of each pole push them back. This balance explains where the cyclones reside and the different numbers at each pole. Magnetosphere The Jovian magnetosphere is the region of space influenced by Jupiter's powerful magnetic field. It balloons 600,000 to 2 million miles (1 to 3 million kilometers) toward the Sun (seven to 21 times the diameter of Jupiter itself) and tapers into a tadpole-shaped tail extending more than 600 million miles (1 billion kilometers) behind Jupiter, as far as Saturn's orbit. Jupiter's enormous magnetic field is 16 to 54 times as powerful as that of the Earth. It rotates with the planet and sweeps up particles that have an electric charge\n\n# Key Entities (LLM Graph)\n\n## EARTH (PLANET)\nA planet listed as a component under 'The Solar System' menu category.\n\n## VENUS (PLANET)\nA planet listed as a component under 'The Solar System' menu category.\n\n## MERCURY (PLANET)\nA planet listed as a component under 'The Solar System' menu category.\n\n## MAGNETOSPHERE (ENTITY)\nThe region around Jupiter influenced by its magnetic field.

This temperature range could accommodate Earthly life, such as “extremophile” microbes. And atmospheric pressure at that height is similar to what we find on Earth’s surface.\nAt the tops of Venus’ clouds, whipped around the planet by winds measured as high as 224 mph (360 kph), we find another transformation. Persistent, dark streaks appear. Scientists are so far unable to explain why these streaks remain stubbornly intact, even amid hurricane-force winds. They also have the odd habit of absorbing ultraviolet radiation.\nThe most likely explanations focus on fine particles, ice crystals, or even a chemical compound called iron chloride. Although it's much less likely, another possibility considered by scientists who study astrobiology is that these streaks could be made up of microbial life, Venus-style. Astrobiologists note that ring-shaped linkages of sulfur atoms, known to exist in Venus’ atmosphere, could provide microbes with a kind of coating that would protect them from sulfuric acid. These handy chemical cloaks would also absorb potentially damaging ultraviolet light and re-radiate it as visible light.\nSome of the Russian Venera probes did, indeed, detect particles in Venus’ lower atmosphere about a micron in length – roughly the same size as a bacterium on Earth.\nNone of these findings provide compelling evidence for the existence of life in Venus’ clouds. But the questions they raise, along with Venus’ vanished ocean, its violently volcanic surface, and its hellish history, make a compelling case for missions to investigate our temperamental sister planet.

NASA missions have found lots of evidence that Mars was much wetter and warmer, with a thicker atmosphere, billions of years ago.\nMars was named by the Romans for their god of war because its reddish color was reminiscent of blood. The Egyptians called it \"Her Desher,\" meaning \"the red one.\"\nEven today, it is frequently called the \"Red Planet\" because iron minerals in the Martian dirt oxidize, or rust, causing the surface to look red. Namesake Mars was named by the ancient Romans for their god of war because its reddish color was reminiscent of blood.

Venus 3. Venus: Facts Venus Home Facts Exploration Resources Solar System Home Venus Facts Venus is the second planet from the Sun, and our closest planetary neighbor. It's the hottest planet in our solar system, and is sometimes called Earth's twin. Introduction Namesake Potential for Life Size and Distance Orbit and Rotation Moons Rings Formation Structure Surface Atmosphere Magnetosphere Introduction As it sped away from Venus in February 1974, NASA’s Mariner 10 spacecraft captured this seemingly peaceful view of Venus. But, contrary to its serene appearance, Venus is a world of intense heat, crushing atmospheric pressure and clouds of corrosive acid.\nNASA/JPL-Caltech\nVenus is the second planet from the Sun, and Earth's closest planetary neighbor. Venus is the third brightest object in the sky after the Sun and Moon. Venus spins slowly in the opposite direction from most planets. \nVenus is similar in structure and size to Earth, and is sometimes called Earth's evil twin. Its thick atmosphere traps heat in a runaway greenhouse effect, making it the hottest planet in our solar system with surface temperatures hot enough to melt lead. Below the dense, persistent clouds, the surface has volcanoes and deformed mountains. Namesake The ancient Romans could easily see seven bright objects in the sky: the Sun, the Moon, and the five brightest planets: Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. They named the objects after their most important gods. \nVenus is named for the ancient Roman goddess of love and beauty, who was known as Aphrodite to the ancient Greeks. Most features on Venus are named for women. It’s the only planet named after a female god. Potential for Life Thirty miles up (about 50 kilometers) from the surface of Venus temperatures range from 86 to 158 Fahrenheit (30 to 70 Celsius). This temperature range\n\n## From: Solar_System\n three times taller than Earth's Mt. Everest with a base the size of the state of New Mexico.\nMars appears to have had a watery past, with ancient river valley networks, deltas, and lakebeds, as well as rocks and minerals on the surface that could only have formed in liquid water. Some features suggest that Mars experienced huge floods about 3.5 billion years ago.\nThere is water on Mars today, but the Martian atmosphere is too thin for liquid water to exist for long on the surface. Today, water on Mars is found in the form of water-ice just under the surface in the polar regions as well as in briny (salty) water, which seasonally flows down some hillsides and crater walls. Atmosphere Mars has a thin atmosphere made up mostly of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and argon gases. To our eyes, the sky would be hazy and red because of suspended dust instead of the familiar blue tint we see on Earth. Mars' sparse atmosphere doesn't offer much protection from impacts by such objects as meteorites, asteroids, and comets.\nThe temperature on Mars can be as high as 70 degrees Fahrenheit (20 degrees Celsius) or as low as about -225 degrees Fahrenheit (-153 degrees Celsius). And because the atmosphere is so thin, heat from the Sun easily escapes this planet. If you were to stand on the surface of Mars on the equator at noon, it would feel like spring at your feet (75 degrees Fahrenheit or 24 degrees Celsius) and winter at your head (32 degrees Fahrenheit or 0 degrees Celsius).\nOccasionally, winds on Mars are strong enough to create dust storms that cover much of the planet. After such storms, it can be months before all of the dust settles. Magnetosphere Mars has no global magnetic field today, but areas of the Martian crust in the southern hemisphere are highly magnetized, indicating traces of a magnetic field from 4 billion years ago.\nKeep Exploring Discover\n\n## From: Solar_System\nBooks * STEM Multimedia * NASA+ Search Suggested Searches Climate Change Artemis Expedition 64 Mars perseverance SpaceX Crew-2 International

Uranus also has traces of water and ammonia.  Methane gives both planets their blue hues.\n\n**Notable Atmospheric Features:**\n\n* **Neptune:**  Is the windiest world in the solar system with winds three times stronger than Jupiter's and nine times stronger than Earth's (over 1,200 mph).  Neptune has large, oval-shaped storms, like the \"Great Dark Spot\" observed in 1989.\n* **Uranus:**  Wind speeds can reach up to 560 mph.

        "expected_output": "Uranus was the first planet discovered with the aid of a telescope by William Herschel in 1781, although initially mistaken for a comet or star. Neptune, conversely, was the first planet located through mathematical predictions based on observed irregularities in Uranus's orbit, proposed by Urbain Joseph Le Verrier and first observed by Johann Gottfried Galle in 1846. Both planets' atmospheres are primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, with methane being a key component that gives them their blueish colors (though Voyager 2 images of Neptune were enhanced, making it appear deeper blue than Uranus; recent reprocessing shows more similar hues). Uranus exhibits dynamic clouds and features like a past Great Dark Spot, with wind speeds reaching up to 560 miles per hour (900 km/h). Neptune is known as the solar system's windiest world, with winds exceeding 1,200 miles per hour (2,000 km/h) whipping frozen methane clouds; it featured a famous Great Dark Spot which has since disappeared, but new storms continue to form. Both ice giants have unusual magnetospheres; Uranus's magnetic field is tilted nearly 60 degrees from its rotational axis and significantly offset from the planet's center, leading to irregularly shaped magnetosphere and non-polar auroras. Neptune's magnetic field is similarly tilted by about 47 degrees and offset, causing wild variations during rotation and is about 27 times more powerful than Earth's.",
        "retrieval_context": "# Relevant Information from Source Documents (LLM Graph)\n\n## From: Solar_System\n boil away because incredibly high pressure keeps it locked inside. Surface Neptune does not have a solid surface. Its atmosphere (made up mostly of hydrogen, helium, and methane) extends to great depths, gradually merging into water and other melted ices over a heavier, solid core with about the same mass as Earth. Atmosphere Neptune's atmosphere is made up mostly of hydrogen and helium with just a little bit of methane. Neptune's neighbor Uranus has a similar makeup; the methane absorbs other colors but reflects blue, giving these ice giants their similar hue. Many images of Neptune, coming from the Voyager 2 flyby in 1989, show Neptune as a much deeper blue. This was because the Voyager team tweaked the images, to better reveal clouds and other distinctive features on the planet, compared to the hazy, uniform view of Uranus that Voyager 2 had captured in 1986. Researchers in 2024 re-processed the images , showing the planets look much more alike than many thought.\nNeptune is our solar system's windiest world. Despite its great distance and low energy input from the Sun, Neptune's winds can be three times stronger than Jupiter's and nine times stronger than Earth's. These winds whip clouds of frozen methane across the planet at speeds of more than 1,200 miles per hour (2,000 kilometers per hour). Even Earth's most powerful winds hit only about 250 miles per hour (400 kilometers per hour).\nIn 1989 a large, oval-shaped storm in Neptune's southern hemisphere dubbed the \"Great Dark Spot\" was large enough to contain the entire Earth. That storm has since disappeared, but new ones have appeared on different parts of the planet. Magnetosphere The main axis of Neptune's magnetic field is tipped over by about 47 degrees compared with the planet's rotation axis. Like Uranus, whose magnetic axis is tilted about 60 degrees from the axis of rotation, Neptune's magnetosphere undergoes wild variations during each rotation because of this misalignment. The magnetic field\n\n## From: Solar_System\n to the Sun and moved to the outer solar system about 4 billion years ago, where it is the seventh planet from the Sun. Structure Uranus is one of two ice giants in the outer solar system (the other is Neptune). Most (80% or more) of the planet's mass is made up of a hot dense fluid of \"icy\" materials – water, methane, and ammonia – above a small rocky core. Near the core, it heats up to 9,000 degrees Fahrenheit (4,982 degrees Celsius).\nUranus is slightly larger in diameter than its neighbor Neptune, yet smaller in mass. It is the second least dense planet; Saturn is the least dense of all.\nUranus gets its blue-green color from methane gas in the atmosphere. Sunlight passes through the atmosphere and is reflected back out by Uranus' cloud tops. Methane gas absorbs the red portion of the light, resulting in a blue-green color. Surface As an ice giant, Uranus doesn’t have a true surface. The planet is mostly swirling fluids. While a spacecraft would have nowhere to land on Uranus, it wouldn’t be able to fly through its atmosphere unscathed either. The extreme pressures and temperatures would destroy a metal spacecraft. Atmosphere Uranus' atmosphere is mostly hydrogen and helium, with a small amount of methane and traces of water and ammonia. The methane gives Uranus its signature blue color.\nWhile Voyager 2 saw only a few discrete clouds, a Great Dark Spot, and a small dark spot during its flyby in 1986 – more recent observations reveal that Uranus exhibits dynamic clouds as it approaches equinox, including rapidly changing bright features.\nUranus' planetary atmosphere, with a minimum temperature of 49K (-224.2 degrees Celsius) makes it even colder than Neptune in some places.\nWind speeds can reach up to 560 miles per hour (900 kilometers per hour) on Uranus. Winds are retro\n\n## From: Solar_System\n that wrap around the planet. Strong east-west winds moving in opposite directions separate the bands. Juno previously discovered that these winds, or jet streams, reach depths of about 2,000 miles (roughly 3,200 kilometers). Researchers are still trying to solve the mystery of how the jet streams form. Data collected by Juno during multiple passes reveal one possible clue: that the atmosphere’s ammonia gas travels up and down in remarkable alignment with the observed jet streams.\nJuno’s data also shows that the belts and zones undergo a transition around 40 miles (65 kilometers) beneath Jupiter’s water clouds. At shallow depths, Jupiter’s belts are brighter in microwave light than the neighboring zones. But at deeper levels, below the water clouds, the opposite is true – which reveals a similarity to our oceans. Polar Cyclones Juno previously discovered polygonal arrangements of giant cyclonic storms at both of Jupiter’s poles – eight arranged in an octagonal pattern in the north and five arranged in a pentagonal pattern in the south. Over time, mission scientists determined these atmospheric phenomena are extremely resilient, remaining in the same location.\nJuno data also indicates that, like hurricanes on Earth, these cyclones want to move poleward, but cyclones located at the center of each pole push them back. This balance explains where the cyclones reside and the different numbers at each pole. Magnetosphere The Jovian magnetosphere is the region of space influenced by Jupiter's powerful magnetic field. It balloons 600,000 to 2 million miles (1 to 3 million kilometers) toward the Sun (seven to 21 times the diameter of Jupiter itself) and tapers into a tadpole-shaped tail extending more than 600 million miles (1 billion kilometers) behind Jupiter, as far as Saturn's orbit. Jupiter's enormous magnetic field is 16 to 54 times as powerful as that of the Earth. It rotates with the planet and sweeps up particles that have an electric charge\n\n## From: Solar_System\n spacecraft would have nowhere to land on Saturn, it wouldn’t be able to fly through unscathed either. The extreme pressures and temperatures deep inside the planet would crush, melt, and vaporize any spacecraft trying to fly into the planet. Atmosphere Saturn is blanketed with clouds that appear as faint stripes, jet streams, and storms. The planet is many different shades of yellow, brown, and gray.\nWinds in the upper atmosphere reach 1,600 feet per second (500 meters per second) in the equatorial region. In contrast, the strongest hurricane-force winds on Earth top out at about 360 feet per second (110 meters per second). And the pressure – the same kind you feel when you dive deep underwater – is so powerful it squeezes gas into a liquid.\nSaturn's north pole has an interesting atmospheric feature – a six-sided jet stream. This hexagon-shaped pattern was first noticed in images from the Voyager I spacecraft and has been more closely observed by the Cassini spacecraft since. Spanning about 20,000 miles (30,000 kilometers) across, the hexagon is a wavy jet stream of 200-mile-per-hour winds (about 322 kilometers per hour) with a massive, rotating storm at the center. There is no weather feature like it anywhere else in the solar system. Magnetosphere Saturn's magnetic field is smaller than Jupiter's but still 578 times as powerful as Earth's. Saturn, the rings, and many of the satellites lie totally within Saturn's enormous magnetosphere, the region of space in which the behavior of electrically charged particles is influenced more by Saturn's magnetic field than by the solar wind.\nAurorae occur when charged particles spiral into a planet's atmosphere along magnetic field lines. On Earth, these charged particles come from the solar wind. Cassini showed that at least some of Saturn's aurorae are like Jupiter's and are largely unaffected by the solar wind. Instead,\n\n## From: Solar_System\n on Uranus. Winds are retrograde at the equator, blowing in the reverse direction of the planet’s rotation. But closer to the poles, winds shift to a prograde direction, flowing with Uranus' rotation. Magnetosphere Uranus has an unusual, irregularly shaped magnetosphere. Magnetic fields are typically in alignment with a planet's rotation, but Uranus' magnetic field is tipped over: the magnetic axis is tilted nearly 60 degrees from the planet's axis of rotation, and is also offset from the center of the planet by one-third of the planet's radius.\nUranus has auroras, but they are not in line with the poles like they are on Earth, Jupiter, and Saturn. This is due to the planet's lopsided magnetic field.\nThe magnetosphere tail behind Uranus opposite the Sun extends into space for millions of miles. Its magnetic field lines are twisted by Uranus’ sideways rotation into a long corkscrew shape.\nKeep Exploring Discover More Topics From NASA Sun Planets Asteroids, Comets & Meteors Kuiper Belt National Aeronautics and Space Administration NASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery.\n  * About NASA's Mission Join Us * Home * News & Events * Multimedia * NASA+ * Missions * Humans in Space * Earth * The Solar System * The Universe * Science * Aeronautics * Technology * Learning Resources * About NASA * NASA en Español Follow NASA More NASA Social Accounts NASA Newsletters Sitemap For Media Privacy Policy FOIA No FEAR Act Office of the IG Budget & Annual Reports Agency Financial Reports Contact NASA Accessibility Page Last Updated: \nApr 21, 2025 Page Editor: \nAMANDA BARNETT Responsible NASA Official for Science: \nDana Bolles\n\n* Explore Search * News & Events ### News & Events * Recently\n\n## From: Solar_System\n shadows, it could be cold enough to preserve water ice despite the high temperatures on sunlit parts of the planet.

Though Mercury's magnetic field at the surface has just 1% the strength of Earth's, it interacts with the magnetic field of the solar wind to sometimes create intense magnetic tornadoes that funnel the fast, hot solar wind plasma down to the surface of the planet.

        "retrieval_context": "# Relevant Information from Source Documents (LLM Graph)\n\n## From: Solar_System\n of its last looks at Saturn, and its main rings from a distance. The images used to create this view were taken on Oct. 28, 2016. The spacecraft arrived at Saturn in 2004, and the mission ended Sept.15, 2017.\nCredits: NASA/JPL-Caltech/Space Science Institute\nLike fellow gas giant Jupiter, Saturn is a massive ball made mostly of hydrogen and helium. Saturn is not the only planet to have rings, but none are as spectacular or as complex as Saturn's. Saturn also has dozens of moons.\nFrom the jets of water that spray from Saturn's moon Enceladus to the methane lakes on smoggy Titan , the Saturn system is a rich source of scientific discovery and still holds many mysteries. Namesake The farthest planet from Earth discovered by the unaided human eye, Saturn has been known since ancient times. The planet is named for the Roman god of agriculture and wealth, who was also the father of Jupiter. Potential for Life Saturn's environment is not conducive to life as we know it. The temperatures, pressures, and materials that characterize this planet are most likely too extreme and volatile for organisms to adapt to.\nWhile planet Saturn is an unlikely place for living things to take hold, the same is not true of some of its many moons. Satellites like Enceladus and Titan, home to internal oceans, could possibly support life. Size and Distance With an equatorial diameter of about 74,897 miles (120,500 kilometers), Saturn is 9 times wider than Earth. If Earth were the size of a nickel, Saturn would be about as big as a volleyball.\nFrom an average distance of 886 million miles (1.4 billion kilometers), Saturn is 9.5 astronomical units away from the Sun. One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth. From this distance, it takes sunlight 80 minutes to travel from the Sun to Saturn\n\n## From: Solar_System\n hold, the same is not true of some of its many moons. Europa is one of the likeliest places to find life elsewhere in our solar system. There is evidence of a vast ocean just beneath its icy crust, where life could possibly be supported. Size and Distance With a radius of 43,440.7 miles (69,911 kilometers), Jupiter is 11 times wider than Earth. If Earth were the size of a grape, Jupiter would be about as big as a basketball.\nFrom an average distance of 484 million miles (778 million kilometers), Jupiter is 5.2 astronomical units away from the Sun. One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth. From this distance, it takes sunlight 43 minutes to travel from the Sun to Jupiter. Orbit and Rotation Jupiter has the shortest day in the solar system. One day on Jupiter takes 9.9 hours (the time it takes for Jupiter to rotate or spin around once), and Jupiter makes a complete orbit around the Sun (a year in Jovian time) in about 12 Earth years (4,333 Earth days).\nIts equator is tilted with respect to its orbital path around the Sun by just 3 degrees. This means Jupiter spins nearly upright and does not have seasons as extreme as other planets do. Moons With four large moons and many smaller moons, Jupiter forms a kind of miniature solar system. \nJupiter has 95 moons that are officially recognized by the International Astronomical Union. The four largest moons – Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto – were first observed by the astronomer Galileo Galilei in 1610 using an early version of the telescope. These four moons are known today as the Galilean satellites, and they're some of the most fascinating destinations in our solar system. \nIo is the most volcanically active body in the solar system. Ganymede is the largest moon in the solar system (even bigger than\n\n## From: Solar_System\n the solar system (even bigger than the planet Mercury). Callisto’s very few small craters indicate a small degree of current surface activity. A liquid-water ocean with the ingredients for life may lie beneath the frozen crust of Europa, the target of NASA's Europa Clipper mission slated to launch in 2024. \n› More on Jupiter's Moons Rings Discovered in 1979 by NASA's Voyager 1 spacecraft, Jupiter's rings were a surprise. The rings are composed of small, dark particles, and they are difficult to see except when backlit by the Sun. Data from the Galileo spacecraft indicate that Jupiter's ring system may be formed by dust kicked up as interplanetary meteoroids smash into the giant planet's small innermost moons. Formation Jupiter took shape along with rest of the solar system about 4.6 billion years ago. Gravity pulled swirling gas and dust together to form this gas giant. Jupiter took most of the mass left over after the formation of the Sun, ending up with more than twice the combined material of the other bodies in the solar system. In fact, Jupiter has the same ingredients as a star, but it did not grow massive enough to ignite.\nAbout 4 billion years ago, Jupiter settled into its current position in the outer solar system, where it is the fifth planet from the Sun. Structure The composition of Jupiter is similar to that of the Sun – mostly hydrogen and helium. Deep in the atmosphere, pressure and temperature increase, compressing the hydrogen gas into a liquid. This gives Jupiter the largest ocean in the solar system – an ocean made of hydrogen instead of water. Scientists think that, at depths perhaps halfway to the planet's center, the pressure becomes so great that electrons are squeezed off the hydrogen atoms, making the liquid electrically conducting like metal. Jupiter's fast rotation is thought to drive electrical currents in this region, with the spinning of the liquid metallic hydrogen acting like a dynamo, generating the planet's powerful magnetic field. \n\n\n## From: Solar_System\n Highlights 2 min readHubble Images a Peculiar Spiralarticle3 days ago 6 min readNASA’s Juno Mission Gets Under Jupiter’s and Io’s Surfacearticle5 days ago 6 min readWhat’s Up: May 2025 Skywatching Tips from NASAarticle3 days ago Back Missions Search All NASA Missions A to Z List of Missions Upcoming Launches and Landings Spaceships and Rockets Communicating with Missions Artemis James Webb Space Telescope Hubble Space Telescope International Space Station OSIRIS-REx Humans in Space Why Go to Space Astronauts Commercial Space Destinations Spaceships and Rockets Living in Space Earth Explore Earth Science Climate Change Earth, Our Planet Earth Science in Action Earth Multimedia Earth Data Earth Science Researchers The Solar System The Sun Mercury Venus Earth The Moon Mars Jupiter Saturn Uranus Neptune Pluto & Dwarf Planets Asteroids, Comets & Meteors The Kuiper Belt The Oort Cloud Skywatching The Universe Exoplanets The Search for Life in the Universe Stars Galaxies Black Holes The Big Bang Dark Matter Dark Energy Science Earth Science Planetary Science Astrophysics & Space Science The Sun & Heliophysics Biological & Physical Sciences Lunar Science Citizen Science Astromaterials Aeronautics Research Human Space Travel Research Aeronautics Science in the Air NASA Aircraft Flight Innovation Supersonic Flight Air Traffic Solutions Green Aviation Tech Drones & You Technology Technology Transfer & Spinoffs Space Travel Technology Technology Living in Space Manufacturing and Materials Robotics Science Instruments Computing Learning Resources For Kids and Students For Educators For Colleges and Universities For Professionals Science for Everyone Requests for Exhibits, Artifacts, or Speakers STEM Engagement at NASA About NASA NASA's Impacts Centers and Facilities Directorates Organizations People of NASA Careers Internships Our History Doing Business with NASA Get Involved Contact NASA en Español Ciencia Aeronáutica Ciencias Terrestres Sistema Solar Universo News & Events Recently Published Video Series\n\n## From: Solar_System\n hollow shell, 1,000 Earths could fit inside.

At the time the images were taken, the spacecraft was between 16,700 miles (26,900 kilometers) and 59,300 miles (95,400 kilometers) above Jupiter's cloud tops.\nCredits: Enhanced image by Kevin M. Gill (CC-BY) based on images provided courtesy of NASA/JPL-Caltech/SwRI/MSSS\nJupiter's signature stripes and swirls are actually cold, windy clouds of ammonia and water, floating in an atmosphere of hydrogen and helium. The dark orange stripes are called belts, while the lighter bands are called zones, and they flow east and west in opposite directions. Jupiter’s iconic Great Red Spot is a giant storm bigger than Earth that has raged for hundreds of years.\nThe king of planets was named for Jupiter, king of the gods in Roman mythology. Most of its moons are also named for mythological characters, figures associated with Jupiter or his Greek counterpart, Zeus. Namesake Jupiter, being the biggest planet, gets its name from the king of the ancient Roman gods. Potential for Life Jupiter’s environment is probably not conducive to life as we know it.

Our solar system is located in the Milky Way, a barred spiral galaxy with two major arms, and two minor arms. Our Sun is in a small, partial arm of the Milky Way called the Orion Arm, or Orion Spur, between the Sagittarius and Perseus arms. Our solar system orbits the center of the galaxy at about 515,000 mph (828,000 kph). It takes about 230 million years to complete one orbit around the galactic center.\nUnable to render the provided source Namesake Our planetary system is called “the solar system” because we use the word “solar” to describe things related to our star, after the Latin word for Sun, \"solis.\" Potential for Life So far, we've only know about life on Earth, but NASA is searching for life on other worlds in our solar system and beyond. Size and Distance Our solar system extends much farther than the planets that orbit the Sun. The solar system also includes the Kuiper Belt that lies past Neptune's orbit. This is a ring of icy bodies, almost all smaller than the most popular Kuiper Belt Object – dwarf planet Pluto .\nBeyond the fringes of the Kuiper Belt is the Oort Cloud . This giant spherical shell surrounds our solar system. It has never been directly observed, but its existence is predicted based on mathematical models and observations of comets that likely originate there.\nThe Oort Cloud is made of icy pieces of space debris - some bigger than mountains – orbiting our Sun as far as 1.6 light-years away.

The mountains are big blocks of water ice, sometimes with a coating of frozen gases like methane. Long troughs and valleys as long as 370 miles (600 kilometers) add to the interesting features of this faraway dwarf planet.\nCraters as large as 162 miles (260 kilometers) in diameter dot some of the landscape on Pluto, with some showing signs of erosion and filling. This suggests tectonic forces are slowly resurfacing Pluto.\nThe most prominent plains observed on Pluto appear to be made of frozen nitrogen gas and show no craters. These plains do show structures suggesting convection (blobs of material circulating up and down). Atmosphere Pluto has a thin, tenuous atmosphere that expands when it comes closer to the Sun and collapses as it moves farther away – similar to a comet. The main constituent is molecular nitrogen, though molecules of methane and carbon monoxide have also been detected.\nWhen Pluto is close to the Sun, its surface ices sublimate (changing directly from solid to gas) and rise to temporarily form a thin atmosphere. Pluto's low gravity (about 6% of Earth's) causes the atmosphere to be much more extended in altitude than our planet's atmosphere. Pluto becomes much colder during the part of each year when it is traveling far away from the Sun. During this time, the bulk of the planet's atmosphere may freeze and fall as snow to the surface.

Orbit and Rotation Eris takes 557 Earth years to make one trip around the Sun. The plane of Eris' orbit is well out of the plane of the solar system's planets and extends far beyond the Kuiper Belt, a zone of icy debris beyond the orbit of Neptune.\nAs Eris orbits the Sun, it completes one rotation every 25.9 hours, making its day length similar to ours. Moons Eris has a very small moon called Dysnomia. Dysnomia has a nearly circular orbit lasting about 16 days. This moon is named after Eris' daughter, the demon goddess of lawlessness.\nDysnomia and other small moons around planets and dwarf planets allow astronomers to calculate the mass of the parent body. Dysnomia plays a role in determining how comparable Pluto and Eris are to each other. Rings Eris has no known rings. Formation Dwarf planet Eris is a member of a group of objects that orbit in a disc-like zone beyond the orbit of Neptune called the Kuiper Belt. This distant realm is populated with thousands of miniature icy worlds, which formed early in the history of our solar system about 4.5 billion years ago. These icy, rocky bodies are called Kuiper Belt objects, transneptunian objects, or plutoids. Structure We know very little about Eris' internal structure. Surface Eris most likely has a rocky surface similar to Pluto. Scientists think surface temperatures vary from about -359 degrees Fahrenheit (-217 degrees Celsius) to -405 degrees Fahrenheit (-243 degrees Celsius). Atmosphere The dwarf planet is often so far from the Sun that its atmosphere collapses and freezes, falling to the surface as snow. As it gets closest to the Sun in its faraway orbit, the atmosphere thaws. Magnetosphere Nothing is known about Eris' magnetosphere.\none of nine? more or less? What is a Planet? Pluto fans\n\n## From: Solar_System\n Sun is unusual compared to the planets: it's both elliptical and tilted. Pluto's 248-year-long, oval-shaped orbit can take it as far as 49.3 astronomical units (AU) from the Sun, and as close as 30 AU. (One AU is the mean distance between Earth and the Sun: about 93 million miles or 150 million kilometers.) But on average, Pluto is 3.7 billion miles (5.9 billion kilometers) away from the Sun, or 39 AU.\nFrom 1979 to 1999, Pluto was near perihelion, when it is closest to the Sun. During this time, Pluto was actually closer to the Sun than Neptune.\nOne day on Pluto takes about 153 hours. Its axis of rotation is tilted 57 degrees with respect to the plane of its orbit around the Sun, so it spins almost on its side. Pluto also exhibits a retrograde rotation; spinning from east to west like Venus and Uranus. Moons Pluto has five known moons: Charon, Nix, Hydra, Kerberos, and Styx. This moon system might have formed by a collision between Pluto and another similar-sized body early in the history of the solar system.\nCharon, the biggest of Pluto's moons, is about half the size of Pluto itself, making it the largest satellite relative to the planet it orbits in our solar system. It orbits Pluto at a distance of just 12,200 miles (19,640 kilometers). For comparison, our Moon is 20 times farther away from Earth. Pluto and Charon are often referred to as a double planet.\nCharon's orbit around Pluto takes 153 hours – the same time it takes Pluto to complete one rotation. This means Charon neither rises nor sets, but hovers over the same spot on Pluto's surface. The same side of Charon always faces Pluto, a state called tidal locking.\nPluto's other four moons are much smaller, less than 100 miles (160\n\n## From: Solar_System\n ago Explore This Section\n  1. … 2.

Introduction Namesake Potential for Life Size and Distance Orbit and Rotation Moons Rings Formation Structure Surface Atmosphere Magnetosphere Introduction Unable to render the provided source\nEyes of the Solar System uses data and images from NASA missions to give you a simulated view of Makemake.\nMakemake is slightly smaller than Pluto, and is the second-brightest object in the Kuiper Belt as seen from Earth while Pluto is the brightest. It takes about 305 Earth years for this dwarf planet to make one trip around the Sun.\nMakemake holds an important place in the history of solar system studies because it was one of the objects – along with Eris – whose discovery prompted the International Astronomical Union to reconsider the definition of a planet, and to create the new group of dwarf planets.\nMakemake was first observed in March 2005 by M.E. Brown, C.A. Trujillo, and D.L. Rabinowitz at the Palomar Observatory, California. Its unofficial codename was Easterbunny, Brown said, \"in honor of the fact that it was discovered just a few days past Easter.\" Before this dwarf planet was confirmed, its provisional name was 2005 FY9. In 2016, NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope spotted a small, dark moon orbiting Makemake. Namesake Makemake was named after the Rapanui god of fertility. Potential for Life The surface of Makemake is extremely cold, so it seems unlikely that life could exist there. Size and\n\n## From: Solar_System\n life could exist there. Size and Distance With a radius of approximately 444 miles (715 kilometers), Makemake is 1/9 the radius of Earth. If Earth were the size of a nickel, Makemake would be about as big as a mustard seed.\nFrom an average distance of 4,253,000,000 miles (6,847,000,000 kilometers), Makemake is 45.8 astronomical units away from the Sun. One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth. From this distance, it takes sunlight 6 hours and 20 minutes to travel from the Sun to Makemake. Orbit and Rotation Makemake takes 305 Earth years to make one trip around the Sun. As Makemake orbits the Sun, it completes one rotation every 22 and a half hours, making its day length similar to Earth and Mars. Moons This Hubble image reveals the first moon ever discovered around dwarf planet Makemake. The tiny satellite, located just above Makemake in this image, is barely visible because it is almost lost in the glare of the very bright dwarf planet. Hubble’s sharp-eyed WFC3 made the observation in April 2015.\nNASA, ESA, and A. Parker and M. Buie (SwRI)\nMakemake has one provisional moon, S/2015 (136472) 1, and it's nicknamed MK 2. It is more than 1,300 times fainter than Makemake. MK 2 was seen approximately 13,000 miles from the dwarf planet, and its radius is estimated to be about 50 miles (80 kilometers). Rings There are no known rings around Makemake. Formation Dwarf planet Makemake is a member of a group of objects that orbit in a disc-like zone beyond the orbit of Neptune called the Kuiper Belt. This distant realm is populated with thousands of miniature icy worlds, which formed early in the history of our solar system about 4.5 billion years ago.\n\n## From: Solar_System\n the history of planetary astronomy that lives on,\" said Alan Stern, the principal investigator for NASA's New Horizons mission that flew by Pluto on July 14, 2015.\nPluto's place in mythology can get a little muddled, so we asked Dr. Elizabeth Vandiver, chair of the Department of Classics in Whitman College in Walla Walla, Washington, to clarify the origins of the name.\nHere is her reply:\n\"Pluto is the name of the Roman god of the underworld, equivalent to the Greek Hades. \nHowever, the Greek name \"Plouton\" (from which the Romans derived their name \"Pluto\") was also occasionally used as an alternative name for Hades. But Pluto is definitely the Roman spelling.\" Venetia Burney, the girl who named Pluto.\nCourtesy: Venetia Burney Potential for Life The surface of Pluto is extremely cold, so it's unlikely that life could exist there. At such cold temperatures, water, which is vital for life as we know it, is essentially rock-like. Pluto's interior is warmer, however, and some think there could even be an ocean deep inside. Size and Distance Pluto has an equatorial diameter of about 1,477 miles (2,377 kilometers). Pluto is about 1/5th the width of Earth. \nFrom an average distance of about 3.7 billion miles (5.9 billion kilometers), Pluto is about 39 times farther away than the Earth is from the Sun. From this distance, it takes sunlight 5.5 hours to travel from the Sun to Pluto.\nIf you were to stand on the surface of Pluto at noon, the Sun would be 1/900 the brightness it is here on Earth, or about 300 times as bright as our full moon. There is a moment each day near sunset here on Earth when the light is the same brightness as midday on Pluto.

Introduction Namesake Potential for Life Size and Distance Orbit and Rotation Moons Rings Formation Structure Surface Atmosphere Magnetosphere Introduction Unable to render the provided source\nEyes of the Solar System uses data and images from NASA missions to give you a simulated view of Makemake.\nMakemake is slightly smaller than Pluto, and is the second-brightest object in the Kuiper Belt as seen from Earth while Pluto is the brightest. It takes about 305 Earth years for this dwarf planet to make one trip around the Sun.\nMakemake holds an important place in the history of solar system studies because it was one of the objects – along with Eris – whose discovery prompted the International Astronomical Union to reconsider the definition of a planet, and to create the new group of dwarf planets.\nMakemake was first observed in March 2005 by M.E. Brown, C.A. Trujillo, and D.L. Rabinowitz at the Palomar Observatory, California. Its unofficial codename was Easterbunny, Brown said, \"in honor of the fact that it was discovered just a few days past Easter.\" Before this dwarf planet was confirmed, its provisional name was 2005 FY9. In 2016, NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope spotted a small, dark moon orbiting Makemake. Namesake Makemake was named after the Rapanui god of fertility.

The new ruling reclassifies Pluto as a dwarf planet and reduces the number of planets in the solar system to eight. Both Eris and the asteroid Ceres are also classified as dwarf planets.\n  * Sep 14, 2006: The International Astronomical Union (IAU) announces that the dwarf planet known as Xena will be called Eris, after the Greek goddess of discord. Eris's moon is named Dysnomia, the demon goddess of lawlessness and the daughter of Eris. This is fitting since the discovery of Eris led to the demotion of Pluto from planet to dwarf planet amidst continuing debate in the science community and the public. Namesake This image of dwarf planet Eris (also known as 2003 UB313 or Xena,) was taken using the Samuel Oschin Telescope at the Palomar Observatory.\nOriginally designated 2003 UB313 – and nicknamed for the television warrior Xena by its discovery team – Eris is named for the ancient Greek goddess of discord and strife. The name fits since Eris remains at the center of a scientific debate about the definition of a planet. Potential for Life The surface of Eris is extremely cold, so it seems unlikely that life could exist there. Size and Distance With an equatorial diameter of about 1,500 miles (2,400 kilometers), Eris is about 1/5 the width of Earth. Eris, like Pluto, is a little smaller than Earth's Moon. If the Earth were the size of a nickel, Eris would be about as big as a popcorn kernel.\nFrom an average distance of 6.3 billion miles (10 billion kilometers), Eris is about 68 astronomical units away from the Sun. One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth. From this distance, it takes sunlight more than nine hours to travel from the Sun to the surface of E\n\n## From: Solar_System\n teams claim credit for discovering Haumea citing evidence from observations made in 2003 and 2004 . The International Astronomical Union’s Gazetteer of Planetary Nomenclature lists the discovery location as Sierra Nevada Observatory in Spain on March 7, 2003, but no official discoverer is listed. Haumea is named after the Hawaiian goddess of fertility. Potential for Life Haumea is extremely cold and doesn't appear to have conditions suitable for life. Size and Distance With an equatorial diameter of about 1,080 miles (about 1,740 kilometers), Haumea is about 1/7 the width of Earth. If Earth were the size of a nickel, Haumea would be about as big as a sesame seed. From an average distance of 4 billion miles (6.5 billion kilometers), Haumea is 43 astronomical units away from the Sun. One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth. From this distance, it takes sunlight 6 hours to travel from the Sun to Haumea. O rbit and Rotation Haumea takes 285 Earth years to make one trip around the Sun. As Haumea orbits the Sun, it completes one rotation every 4 hours, making it one of the fastest rotating large objects in our solar system.\nIt is possible that a large object impacted Haumea billions of years ago and set off Haumea's spin and created its moons. Moons Haumea has two known moons: Namaka is the inner moon, and Hi'iaka is the outer moon. Both were discovered in 2005 and named for the mythological daughters of Haumea. Hi'iaka is the patron goddess of the island of Hawaii and of hula dancers. Namaka is a water spirit in Hawaiian mythology. Rings Haumea is the first known Kuiper Belt Object to have rings.

These missions study planets (Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, etc.), moons, asteroids (Bennu, Psyche, Vesta, etc.), comets, the Sun, and the outer reaches like the Kuiper Belt and Oort Cloud. Human spaceflight, centered around the Artemis program, aims for lunar presence (Lunar Space Station module, prepping for Moon landings with hybrid rocket motors) and potentially Mars. Technological development is crucial, focusing on areas like spacesuits (icy chamber tests), propulsion (hybrid rockets, solar-electric for Psyche), communication (ultralight antennas), power (innovative batteries, Power to Explore Challenge), aircraft technology (thin-wing concepts, X-59 supersonic flight), navigation, and instruments for remote sensing and analysis. Scientific goals span understanding planetary formation (via asteroids like Psyche), searching for life (a key driver, though currently only known on Earth), studying Earth's climate and environment (wildfire data, snowmelt tracking), exploring the universe's origins and composition (Big Bang, dark matter/energy), and ensuring planetary defense (tracking NEOs like 2024 YR4 via CNEOS). The agency utilizes a wide range of tools from ground-based observations to spaceborne telescopes and direct exploration spacecraft, leveraging partnerships (e.g., Boeing, ESA, CSA) and engaging the public and STEM community.",

        "expected_output": "Across the texts, asteroids and comets are presented as fundamentally important targets within NASA's exploration framework. They are characterized as remnants from the solar system's formation ~4.6 billion years ago – asteroids being rocky leftovers primarily found between Mars and Jupiter, and comets being icy bodies originating further out, likely in the Kuiper Belt or Oort Cloud. Their significance lies in their potential to reveal insights into the early solar system, planetary formation (e.g., Psyche potentially being a planetesimal core), and possibly the origins of life's building blocks. NASA employs multiple methods to study them: ground-based telescopes, space telescopes (Hubble, Webb imaging asteroids like 2024 YR4), dedicated robotic missions involving flybys and imaging (Lucy imaging Donaldjohanson and Dinkinesh/Selam), orbital mapping and analysis (Psyche mission plan), and sample return (OSIRIS-REx from Bennu). Featured asteroids like Bennu, Psyche, Donaldjohanson, Vesta, Eros, Ida, Itokawa, Didymos/Dimorphos, and 2024 YR4 highlight diverse characteristics (size, composition - rocky to metal-rich, presence of moons like Selam or Dactyl). Concurrently, their potential hazard is explicitly addressed through Planetary Defense efforts managed by the Planetary Defense Coordination Office (PDCO) and CNEOS, which track Near-Earth Objects (NEOs), compute orbits, assess impact risks (as demonstrated with 2024 YR4), and use science data to defend Earth. Thus, small bodies represent both invaluable scientific archives and a necessary focus for risk mitigation.",

NASA provides information on \"Asteroids, Comets & Meteors\" as a topic.  No overarching strategy is explicitly described.",
        "expected_output": "Based on all the provided texts, NASA employs a multi-faceted strategy for asteroid investigation involving diverse mission types tailored to specific scientific and defense objectives. The strategy includes: 1) Discovery and Characterization: Utilizing ground-based telescopes (Kitt Peak, Arecibo, Goldstone, Green Bank) and space telescopes (Hubble, Roman) to find, track, and perform initial characterization of asteroids, particularly Near-Earth Asteroids (NEAs) like Apophis, Didymos, and Eros, and main-belt asteroids like Vesta and Dinkinesh. 2) Close-Up Reconnaissance: Employing spacecraft for detailed study through flybys (Lucy mission targeting Dinkinesh, Donaldjohanson, and Trojan asteroids; OSIRIS-APEX planned for Apophis) and orbiting (NEAR Shoemaker at Eros, Dawn at Vesta). These missions gather data on size, shape, rotation, surface features, density, and composition. 3) In-depth Compositional Analysis: Conducting sample return missions like OSIRIS-REx (Bennu) to bring pristine asteroid material back to Earth for sophisticated laboratory analysis, addressing fundamental questions about solar system formation, planetary evolution, and the origin of water and organics. 4) Planetary Defense Demonstration: Testing asteroid deflection technologies, primarily through kinetic impactors like the DART mission targeting the Didymos/Dimorphos binary system, to understand how humanity could protect Earth from potential future impacts. Target selection rationale varies: Bennu was chosen for OSIRIS-REx due to its primitive composition and accessibility. Didymos/Dimorphos provided a suitable binary system for measuring deflection in the DART test. Apophis is targeted for study due to its exceptionally close Earth approach in 2029. Lucy targets diverse asteroid types (main belt, Trojans) to understand solar system evolution. Vesta was selected for Dawn as a large, differentiated protoplanet. Eros was an early target for NEA characterization and the first asteroid landing. Overall, the strategy combines remote sensing, close observation, direct interaction, and sample return to build a comprehensive understanding of asteroids' origins, diversity, potential resources, and risks.",

Specifically, the Hayabusa spacecraft experienced a failure of the mechanism designed to collect a sample from the asteroid Itokawa, though it still managed to collect some dust.  The context does not elaborate on other scientific or practical challenges faced during asteroid exploration, nor how those challenges are being addressed.",
        "expected_output": "Across all provided texts, several challenges in asteroid exploration and NASA's approaches to address them emerge. 1) Understanding Asteroid Structure and Composition Remotely: Asteroids exhibit diverse and sometimes unexpected structures, like Dinkinesh's contact binary moon Selam or Vesta's differentiation. Missions like Dawn (Vesta) used orbiting instruments, while Lucy (Dinkinesh) used high-resolution imaging during flyby, discovering Selam's nature only through post-encounter image analysis. OSIRIS-REx addressed this for Bennu via sample return for ground truth. 2) Navigation and Targeting: Precisely reaching and interacting with small, distant, and sometimes rapidly moving objects like asteroids requires sophisticated navigation. DART used its DRACO imager for autonomous optical navigation in its final approach to Dimorphos. NEAR Shoemaker required trajectory adjustments before orbiting Eros. Lucy relies on gravity assists (Earth flyby planned Dec 2024) to reach its multiple targets. 3) Surface Interaction and Sampling: Asteroid surfaces can be unexpectedly rugged (like Bennu and Ryugu mentioned in the DART/Dimorphos context), making landing or sample collection difficult. OSIRIS-REx performed detailed surface mapping before selecting a site on Bennu. The NEAR Shoemaker landing on Eros was successful despite not being designed for it, demonstrating feasibility. OSIRIS-APEX plans to use thrusters to expose subsurface material on Apophis. 4) Planetary Defense - Deflection Effectiveness: Understanding how different asteroid types respond to impacts is crucial for defense. DART's impact on Dimorphos provided the first full-scale data, showing a significant orbital change, but ongoing analysis (using ground-based observatories and radar) is needed to fully understand the momentum enhancement from ejecta. Follow-up missions (like ESA's Hera, which NASA scientists will join) will further study the DART impact site. 5) Mission Complexity and Longevity: Missions like Lucy (12-year journey, 11+ asteroids) and OSIRIS-REx (sample return) are complex, long-duration endeavors requiring sustained operations and robust spacecraft design. OSIRIS-REx was repurposed as OSIRIS-APEX for the Apophis flyby, demonstrating mission adaptability. These challenges are addressed through advanced instrumentation (imagers, radar, spectrometers), sophisticated navigation techniques, robotic operations, multi-mission approaches (combining remote sensing, impactors, sample return), and international collaboration (ASI's LICIACube for DART, participation in ESA's Hera).",

        "expected_output": "Across all provided texts, NASA's approach to exploring the solar system and understanding celestial bodies appears multifaceted. It heavily relies on robotic missions for reconnaissance and in-depth study, employing various strategies: flybys (e.g., Galileo at Ida, Deep Space 1 at Borrelly, Deep Impact/EPOXI at Hartley 2, Giotto at Halley), orbiters (e.g., Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter observing Curiosity), landers/rovers (implied by Curiosity tracking), and sample return (Hayabusa at Itokawa). Space-based observatories like the Hubble Space Telescope and the upcoming Roman Mission are crucial for broader sky surveys and detailed remote analysis. Ground-based observations are fundamental for initial discoveries (as seen with most listed asteroids and comets). A key element is the continuous development and testing of critical technologies enabling these missions, such as advanced navigation systems, robust spacesuits (tested in icy chambers), innovative power sources (new battery tech), lightweight communication systems (ultralight antennas), efficient propulsion (hybrid rocket motors), and protective systems (Orion heat shield analysis). Scientifically, the approach focuses on understanding the origin, composition, structure, and evolution of celestial bodies (e.g., Ida's composition, Itokawa as a 'rubble pile' linked to meteorites, Hartley 2's hyperactive outgassing, Halley's historical appearances). NASA also leverages international collaboration (Halley fleet) and connects exploration activities back to Earth benefits through technology transfer and Earth science applications (wildfire/water management sensors).",

These are often thought to originate from the Kuiper Belt. Jupiter-family comets are a subset of short-period comets whose orbits have been significantly modified by Jupiter's gravity, with periods typically under 20 years; 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko and 9P/Tempel 1 are explicitly mentioned as examples whose orbits were altered by Jupiter. Long-period comets, designated with a 'C', have periods much longer than 200 years and are not expected to return to the inner solar system in a human timescale, likely originating from the Oort Cloud; C/1995 O1 (Hale-Bopp), with a period of about 2,534 years, is the provided example. Finally, interstellar comets, designated with an 'I', originate from outside our solar system; 2I/Borisov is the prime example discussed, identified by its hyperbolic trajectory and high velocity confirming its extrasolar origin.",

For example, carbon-dioxide-driven jets shoot from the ends of the comet, with most occurring from the small end. Water vapor is released from the mid-section with very little, or no carbon dioxide or ice.\nThe comet's surface is dotted with glittering blocks that are approximately 164 feet (50 meters) high and 262 feet (80 meters) wide. These surface features appear to be two to three times more reflective than the surface average. How This Comet Got Its Name Comets are usually named for their discoverer(s) or for the name of the observatory/telescope used in the discovery. Since Malcolm Hartley discovered this comet it is named for him. The letter \"P\" indicates that 103P/Hartley (Hartley 2) is a \"periodic\" comet.

When frozen, they are the size of a small town. When a comet's orbit brings it close to the Sun, it heats up and spews dust and gases into a giant glowing head larger than most planets. The dust and gases form a tail that stretches away from the Sun for millions of miles. There are likely billions of comets orbiting our Sun in the Kuiper Belt and even more distant Oort Cloud.

This is due to the fact that fireballs originate from larger particles of cometary material. Oftentimes, this particular shower exhibits fireballs on or around Halloween, making them known as the Halloween Fireballs.\nComet Encke approached the sun for its close encounter in 2013 at the same time as the much talked about and imaged comet ISON, and because of this was imaged by both the MESSENGER and STEREO spacecraft. A visualization of the constant outflow of material from the Sun, known as the solar wind.\nESA/NASA/SOHO How This Comet Got Its Name Comets are usually named for their discoverer(s) or for the name of the observatory/telescope used in the discovery. However, this comet is not named after its discoverer(s). Instead it is named after Johann Franz Encke who calculated the comet's orbit. The letter P indicates that 2P/Encke is a periodic comet.

        "actual_output": "While the provided text mentions comets, missions, and spacecraft, it primarily focuses on navigational links and website structure.  It lists comets as topics within \"The Solar System\" section, alongside other celestial bodies. Some spacecraft are mentioned in relation to comets, like STEREO imaging Comet Encke and Ulysses studying the impact of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 on Jupiter.  It also mentions \"Eyes on Asteroids\" as a tool to explore comets in 3D.

It does not explain *why* these missions were undertaken or how the technology has changed over time.",
        "expected_output": "The collective information highlights a progression in comet science objectives and methodologies. Early understanding, exemplified by Halley's Comet, focused on predicting orbits and understanding basic characteristics like period variation and aging through mass loss. Later missions aimed for deeper compositional and structural insights. Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko represents a major leap with the Rosetta mission performing long-term orbital escort, in-situ analysis, and landing, revealing details about water composition, molecular gases, and organic compounds like glycine and phosphorus. Comet 81P/Wild 2 was targeted by Stardust for sample return, a technique focused on bringing pristine material back to Earth labs, leading to the confirmation of glycine. Comet 9P/Tempel 1 was subject to kinetic impact analysis by Deep Impact, aiming to probe subsurface material by creating a crater, followed by Stardust NExT observing the aftermath. The study of interstellar Comet 2I/Borisov using telescopes like Hubble focuses on comparative planetology, understanding how comets from other star systems differ from our own. The overarching narrative is one of moving from Earth-based observation and orbit calculation towards increasingly sophisticated in-situ analysis, direct interaction (impacting, landing), and sample return, driven by the goals of understanding solar system formation, the composition of primitive bodies, the potential delivery of life's building blocks to Earth, and the diversity of objects within and beyond our solar system.",

But it will take the spacecraft another 300 years to reach the inner \"edge\" of the Oort cloud and, at its current speed of a million miles a day, some 30,000 years more to finish passing through it.\nOccasionally, some gravitational influence-possibly from a passing star-nudges a comet loose from this incredibly vast and distant depository, and it falls toward the Sun. That is what must have happened to Siding Spring a few million years ago. It has been falling all this time toward the inner solar system, and it's going to give us just one shot at studying it. According to current estimates, its next visit will be in about 740,000 years. Discovery Discovered Jan. 3, 2013 at Siding Spring Observatory, Australia. How This Comet Got Its Name C/ indicates that it is a non-periodic comet. And 2013 A1 indicates that it was the first comet discovered in the first half of January 2013. Siding Spring is the name of the observatory where it was discovered.\nKeep Exploring Discover More Topics From NASA Sun Planets Asteroids, Comets & Meteors Kuiper Belt National Aeronautics and Space

        "actual_output": "The provided context mentions NASA exploring Mars with rovers like Curiosity and Perseverance. It also mentions missions related to Jupiter, the International Space Station, James Webb Space Telescope, Hubble Space Telescope, OSIRIS-REx, and the Moon.  NASA studies the Sun, Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto, dwarf planets, asteroids, comets, meteors, the Kuiper Belt, and the Oort Cloud.  NASA uses spacecraft, telescopes, and software like \"Eyes on the Solar System.\"  The context also mentions \"NASA's Goldstone Solar System Radar.\"  There is mention of topics like \"The Search for Life in the Universe,\" suggesting that is a significant aspect of these explorations.  NASA also engages in outreach, bringing \"exploration\" themes, including robots, rovers, and regolith, to events like \"FIRST Robotics 2025.\"",
        "expected_output": "NASA's solar system exploration strategy, as synthesized from all texts, involves a multi-faceted approach targeting diverse celestial bodies using various methods to advance scientific understanding and potentially planetary defense. Objects studied range from inner planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars) and their moons, to gas giants (Jupiter, Saturn) and ice giants (Uranus, Neptune), dwarf planets (Pluto), and extensive populations of smaller bodies like asteroids, comets (originating from both the Kuiper Belt and the Oort Cloud like Siding Spring and ISON), meteors/meteorites, and Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs) like Arrokoth. Exploration methods include robotic missions with orbiters (e.g., Mars orbiter tracking Curiosity, Galileo at Jupiter), landers/rovers (Curiosity on Mars), flyby spacecraft (Voyager, New Horizons visiting Pluto and Arrokoth), dedicated space telescopes (Hubble, JWST, Roman observing solar system objects and phenomena like SL9 impact), ground-based telescope networks (like ISON and Pan-STARRS1 for discovery), and airborne sensors (though primarily mentioned for Earth). The significance lies in understanding planetary formation and evolution (studying remnants like KBOs and Oort cloud comets), characterizing potentially hazardous objects (NEOO program, Planetary Defense Coordination Office), observing unique events (Siding Spring's Mars pass, SL9's Jupiter impact), searching for life, understanding planetary processes (Jupiter's atmosphere post-SL9 impact), and even studying interstellar visitors ('Oumuamua) to gain insights into processes beyond our solar system. The strategy explicitly connects exploration with benefiting humanity and inspiring discovery.",

Technological advancements enable new scientific discoveries, while scientific questions drive the need for new technologies. Examples include: 1) **Advanced Sensors:** Development of airborne sensors supports Earth Science (wildfire data, snowmelt tracking), while space-based sensors on orbiters and telescopes (Hubble, JWST, Roman) are crucial for Planetary Science (tracking Curiosity, observing comet impacts like SL9) and Astrophysics (studying clusters, exoplanets, interstellar objects like 'Oumuamua). 2) **Spacecraft and Propulsion:** Development of spacecraft like New Horizons enabled the first close-up exploration of Kuiper Belt objects (Pluto, Arrokoth). Testing hybrid rocket motors supports future Moon landings (Artemis program). Understanding the Orion heat shield material loss (Artemis I) informs future mission safety and design. 3) **Instrumentation and Materials:** Testing spacesuit parts in icy chambers is vital for Human Space Travel (Artemis). Research into ultralight antennas benefits future national airspace (Aeronautics) and potentially space communications. Engineering innovative batteries has broad applications. 4) **Observation Platforms:** Ground-based telescope networks (ISON, Pan-STARRS1) complement space telescopes (Hubble) in discovering and tracking comets and asteroids (Planetary Science, Planetary Defense). The International Space Station serves as a platform for science experiments. This synergy is evident in NASA's broad mission statement mentioned repeatedly: exploring air and space, innovating for humanity's benefit, and inspiring through discovery, requiring integration across Aeronautics, Earth Science, Planetary Science, Astrophysics, Heliophysics, Biological/Physical Sciences, and Human Spaceflight, all underpinned by technology.",

A core theme is understanding origins and system dynamics – how the solar system formed (Kuiper Belt remnants, planet migration), how celestial bodies interact (Sun-Earth connection, Neptune's influence), and the potential for life. NASA prioritizes sharing knowledge through extensive learning resources, multimedia platforms (NASA+), public outreach (STEM engagement, citizen science), and making data accessible, fulfilling its mandate to innovate for humanity's benefit and inspire through discovery.",

Beyond Neptune lies the Kuiper Belt, a vast, donut-shaped region of millions of icy remnants from the solar system's formation, extending from about 30 AU to 50 AU (main belt) and overlapping with the scattered disk that goes out to nearly 1,000 AU. This belt contains diverse populations (classical, resonant, scattered) shaped significantly by Neptune's gravity and migration history. It includes dwarf planets like Pluto (the largest KBO), Eris, Makemake, and Haumea. Pluto itself is in a 3:2 orbital resonance with Neptune. The asteroid belt, located between Mars and Jupiter, is another region of leftovers, containing the dwarf planet Ceres. Even more distant is the Oort Cloud, a hypothesized spherical shell surrounding the entire system, thought to be a major source of long-period comets. The Kuiper Belt is also a source, particularly for short-period Jupiter-family comets, produced from collisions and gravitational nudges by Neptune and Jupiter. Objects like Centaurs bridge the gap between the Kuiper Belt and the giant planets. Moons orbit planets, with some like Neptune's Triton and Saturn's Phoebe potentially being captured KBOs. The system is dynamic, with ongoing processes like KBO collisions, comet evolution, and gravitational interactions shaping the orbits and fates of smaller bodies.",

Our solar system is located in the Milky Way, a barred spiral galaxy with two major arms, and two minor arms. Our Sun is in a small, partial arm of the Milky Way called the Orion Arm, or Orion Spur, between the Sagittarius and Perseus arms. Our solar system orbits the center of the galaxy at about 515,000 mph (828,000 kph). It takes about 230 million years to complete one orbit around the galactic center.\nUnable to render the provided source Namesake Our planetary system is called “the solar system” because we use the word “solar” to describe things related to our star, after the Latin word for Sun, \"solis.\" Potential for Life So far, we've only know about life on Earth, but NASA is searching for life on other worlds in our solar system and beyond. Size and Distance Our solar system extends much farther than the planets that orbit the Sun. The solar system also includes the Kuiper Belt that lies past Neptune's orbit. This is a ring of icy bodies, almost all smaller than the most popular Kuiper Belt Object – dwarf planet Pluto .\nBeyond the fringes of the Kuiper Belt is the Oort Cloud . This giant spherical shell surrounds our solar system. It has never been directly observed, but its existence is predicted based on mathematical models and observations of comets that likely originate there.\nThe Oort Cloud is made of icy pieces of space debris - some bigger than mountains – orbiting our Sun as far as 1.6 light-years away. This shell of material is thick, extending from 5,000 astronomical units to\n\n## From: Solar_System\n in Action Earth Multimedia Earth Data Earth Science Researchers The Solar System The Sun Mercury Venus Earth The Moon Mars Jupiter Saturn Uranus Neptune Pluto & Dwarf Planets Asteroids, Comets & Meteors The Kuiper Belt The Oort Cloud Skywatching The Universe Exoplanets The Search for Life in the Universe Stars Galaxies Black Holes The Big Bang Dark Matter Dark Energy Science Earth Science Planetary Science Astrophysics & Space Science The Sun & Heliophysics Biological & Physical Sciences Lunar Science Citizen Science Astromaterials Aeronautics Research Human Space Travel Research Aeronautics Science in the Air NASA Aircraft Flight Innovation Supersonic Flight Air Traffic Solutions Green Aviation Tech Drones & You Technology Technology Transfer & Spinoffs Space Travel Technology Technology Living in Space Manufacturing and Materials Robotics Science Instruments Computing Learning Resources For Kids and Students For Educators For Colleges and Universities For Professionals Science for Everyone Requests for Exhibits, Artifacts, or Speakers STEM Engagement at NASA About NASA NASA's Impacts Centers and Facilities Directorates Organizations People of NASA Careers Internships Our History Doing Business with NASA Get Involved Contact NASA en Español Ciencia Aeronáutica Ciencias Terrestres Sistema Solar Universo News & Events Recently Published Video Series on NASA+ Podcasts Blogs Newsletters Social Media Media Resources Multimedia Images Videos on NASA+ Sounds and Ringtones Interactives NASA Apps Podcasts e-Books STEM Multimedia Highlights 2 min read Hubble Images a Peculiar Spiral article 3 days ago 6 min read NASA’s SPHEREx Space Telescope Begins Capturing Entire Sky article 3 days ago 4 min read NASA’s Chandra Diagnoses Cause of Fracture in Galactic “Bone” article 3 days ago Highlights 1 min read HALO Arrives in the US article 4 days ago 3 min read Lunar Space Station Module for NASA’s Artemis Campaign to Begin Final Outfitting article 1 week\n\n## From: Solar_System\n's Solar System Dynamics website. Formation Our solar system formed about 4.6 billion years ago from a dense cloud of interstellar gas and dust. The cloud collapsed, possibly due to the shockwave of a nearby exploding star, called a supernova. When this dust cloud collapsed, it formed a solar nebula – a spinning, swirling disk of material.\nAt the center, gravity pulled more and more material in. Eventually, the pressure in the core was so great that hydrogen atoms began to combine and form helium, releasing a tremendous amount of energy. With that, our Sun was born, and it eventually amassed more than 99% of the available matter.\nMatter farther out in the disk was also clumping together. These clumps smashed into one another, forming larger and larger objects. Some of them grew big enough for their gravity to shape them into spheres, becoming planets, dwarf planets, and large moons. In other cases, planets did not form: the asteroid belt is made of bits and pieces of the early solar system that could never quite come together into a planet. Other smaller leftover pieces became asteroids, comets, meteoroids, and small, irregular moons. Structure The order and arrangement of the planets and other bodies in our solar system is due to the way the solar system formed. Nearest to the Sun, only rocky material could withstand the heat when the solar system was young. For this reason, the first four planets – Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars – are terrestrial planets. They are all small with solid, rocky surfaces.\nMeanwhile, materials we are used to seeing as ice, liquid, or gas settled in the outer regions of the young solar system. Gravity pulled these materials together, and that is where we find gas giants Jupiter and Saturn, and the ice giants Uranus and Neptune.

Mercury, smallest and closest to the Sun, is heavily cratered, airless with extreme temperature swings, and possesses only a weak, offset magnetic field. Venus, Earth's 'twin' in size and initial structure, suffered a runaway greenhouse effect due to its thick CO2 atmosphere, leading to extreme surface heat capable of melting lead, the loss of its early oceans, and the lack of an intrinsic magnetic field (possessing only an induced one). Earth, uniquely positioned, maintained liquid water on its surface for billions of years, fostering life, and developed a strong magnetic field protecting its atmosphere and surface; its axial tilt creates seasons, and plate tectonics continually reshape its surface. Mars, smaller than Earth and farther from the Sun, shows evidence of a warmer, wetter past with a thicker atmosphere, but lost most of its atmosphere and surface water, becoming a cold, dusty desert with a thin CO2 atmosphere and only remnant localized magnetic fields; its axial tilt also creates seasons, albeit longer and uneven ones, and it hosts the solar system's largest volcano and canyon system.",

Venus: Facts Venus Home Facts Exploration Resources Solar System Home Venus Facts Venus is the second planet from the Sun, and our closest planetary neighbor. It's the hottest planet in our solar system, and is sometimes called Earth's twin. Introduction Namesake Potential for Life Size and Distance Orbit and Rotation Moons Rings Formation Structure Surface Atmosphere Magnetosphere Introduction As it sped away from Venus in February 1974, NASA’s Mariner 10 spacecraft captured this seemingly peaceful view of Venus. But, contrary to its serene appearance, Venus is a world of intense heat, crushing atmospheric pressure and clouds of corrosive acid.\nNASA/JPL-Caltech\nVenus is the second planet from the Sun, and Earth's closest planetary neighbor. Venus is the third brightest object in the sky after the Sun and Moon. Venus spins slowly in the opposite direction from most planets. \nVenus is similar in structure and size to Earth, and is sometimes called Earth's evil twin. Its thick atmosphere traps heat in a runaway greenhouse effect, making it the hottest planet in our solar system with surface temperatures hot enough to melt lead. Below the dense, persistent clouds, the surface has volcanoes and deformed mountains. Namesake The ancient Romans could easily see seven bright objects in the sky: the Sun, the Moon, and the five brightest planets: Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. They named the objects after their most important gods. \nVenus is named for the ancient Roman goddess of love and beauty, who was known as Aphrodite to the ancient Greeks. Most features on Venus are named for women. It’s the only planet named after a female god. Potential for Life Thirty miles up (about 50 kilometers) from the surface of Venus temperatures range from 86 to 158 Fahrenheit (30 to 70 Celsius). This temperature range\n\n## From: Solar_System\n shadows, it could be cold enough to preserve water ice despite the high temperatures on sunlit parts of the planet. Atmosphere Instead of an atmosphere, Mercury possesses a thin exosphere made up of atoms blasted off the surface by the solar wind and striking meteoroids. Mercury's exosphere is composed mostly of oxygen, sodium, hydrogen, helium, and potassium. Magnetosphere Mercury's magnetic field is offset relative to the planet's equator. Though Mercury's magnetic field at the surface has just 1% the strength of Earth's, it interacts with the magnetic field of the solar wind to sometimes create intense magnetic tornadoes that funnel the fast, hot solar wind plasma down to the surface of the planet. When the ions strike the surface, they knock off neutrally charged atoms and send them on a loop high into the sky.\nKeep Exploring Discover More Topics From NASA Sun Planets Asteroids, Comets & Meteors Kuiper Belt National Aeronautics and Space Administration NASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery.\n  * About NASA's Mission Join Us * Home * News & Events * Multimedia * NASA+ * Missions * Humans in Space * Earth * The Solar System * The Universe * Science * Aeronautics * Technology * Learning Resources * About NASA * NASA en Español Follow NASA More NASA Social Accounts NASA Newsletters Sitemap For Media Privacy Policy FOIA No FEAR Act Office of the IG Budget & Annual Reports Agency Financial Reports Contact NASA Accessibility Page Last Updated: \nApr 25, 2025 Page Editor: \nAMANDA BARNETT Responsible NASA Official for Science: \nDana Bolles\n\n* Explore Search * News & Events ### News & Events * Recently Published * Video Series on NASA+ * Podcasts * Blogs * Newsletters * Social Media * Media Resources * Multimedia ### Multimedia * Images * Videos on NASA\n\n## From: Solar_System\n's Solar System Dynamics website. Formation Our solar system formed about 4.6 billion years ago from a dense cloud of interstellar gas and dust. The cloud collapsed, possibly due to the shockwave of a nearby exploding star, called a supernova. When this dust cloud collapsed, it formed a solar nebula – a spinning, swirling disk of material.\nAt the center, gravity pulled more and more material in. Eventually, the pressure in the core was so great that hydrogen atoms began to combine and form helium, releasing a tremendous amount of energy. With that, our Sun was born, and it eventually amassed more than 99% of the available matter.\nMatter farther out in the disk was also clumping together. These clumps smashed into one another, forming larger and larger objects. Some of them grew big enough for their gravity to shape them into spheres, becoming planets, dwarf planets, and large moons. In other cases, planets did not form: the asteroid belt is made of bits and pieces of the early solar system that could never quite come together into a planet. Other smaller leftover pieces became asteroids, comets, meteoroids, and small, irregular moons. Structure The order and arrangement of the planets and other bodies in our solar system is due to the way the solar system formed. Nearest to the Sun, only rocky material could withstand the heat when the solar system was young. For this reason, the first four planets – Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars – are terrestrial planets. They are all small with solid, rocky surfaces.\nMeanwhile, materials we are used to seeing as ice, liquid, or gas settled in the outer regions of the young solar system. Gravity pulled these materials together, and that is where we find gas giants Jupiter and Saturn, and the ice giants Uranus and Neptune.

Atmosphere Venus’ atmosphere is one of extremes. With the hottest surface in the solar system, apart from the Sun itself, Venus is hotter even than the innermost planet, charbroiled Mercury. The atmosphere is mostly carbon dioxide – the same gas driving the greenhouse effect on Venus and Earth – with clouds composed of sulfuric acid. And at the surface, the hot, high-pressure carbon dioxide behaves in a corrosive fashion. But higher up in the atmosphere, temperatures and pressure begin to ease. Magnetosphere Even though Venus is similar in size to Earth and has a similar-sized iron core, the planet does not have its own internally generated magnetic field. Instead, Venus has what is known as an induced magnetic field. This weak magnetic field is created by the interaction of the Sun's magnetic field and the planet's outer atmosphere. Ultraviolet light from the Sun excites gases in Venus' outermost atmosphere; these electrically excited gases are called ions, and thus this region is called the ionosphere (Earth has an ionosphere as well).

Jupiter and Saturn, the gas giants, consist predominantly of hydrogen and helium, akin to the Sun, having captured the bulk of the system's early mass. Uranus and Neptune, the ice giants, also primarily hydrogen and helium, likely formed nearer the Sun before migrating outward; their mass includes a larger fraction of 'icy' materials (water, methane, ammonia) in a hot, dense fluid state above a rocky core. Internally, Jupiter and Saturn feature deep atmospheres transitioning into layers of liquid metallic hydrogen, believed to generate their powerful magnetic fields via dynamo action. Juno mission data suggests Jupiter's core is unexpectedly large and 'fuzzy' (dilute), rather than small and solid. Saturn's core is thought to be similar but smaller, containing metals, rock, and compounds under intense pressure. Uranus and Neptune lack such extensive metallic hydrogen layers. Their structure comprises a small rocky core surrounded by the substantial mantle of icy materials. Atmospherically, hydrogen and helium dominate all four. Jupiter and Saturn display prominent belts and zones driven by strong jet streams. Uranus and Neptune owe their blue-green appearances to atmospheric methane absorbing red light. Jupiter's atmosphere features the Great Red Spot storm, while Saturn has a unique hexagonal jet stream at its north pole, and Neptune boasts the fastest winds. Uranus is unique for its extreme axial tilt (~98 degrees).",

Scientists theorized Jupiter was a mostly homogeneous mix of hydrogen and helium gases, surrounding a small, solid core of heavier elements – ice, rock, and metal formed from debris and small objects swirling around that area of the embryonic solar system 4 billion years ago.\nNASA’s Juno spacecraft, measuring Jupiter’s gravity and magnetic field, found data suggesting the core is much larger than expected, and not solid. Instead, it’s partially dissolved, with no clear separation from the metallic hydrogen around it, leading researchers to describe the core as dilute, or “fuzzy.” Surface As a gas giant, Jupiter doesn’t have a true surface. The planet is mostly swirling gases and liquids. While a spacecraft would have nowhere to land on Jupiter, it wouldn’t be able to fly through unscathed either. The extreme pressures and temperatures deep inside the planet crush, melt, and vaporize spacecraft trying to fly into the planet. Atmosphere Jupiter's appearance is a tapestry of colorful stripes and spots – the cloud bands that encircle the planet, and the cyclonic storms dotting it from pole to pole. The gas planet likely has three distinct cloud layers in its \"skies\" that, taken together, span about 44 miles (71 kilometers). The top cloud is probably made of ammonia ice, while the middle layer is likely made of ammonium hydrosulfide crystals. The innermost layer may be made of water ice and vapor.\nThe vivid colors you see in thick bands across Jupiter may be plumes of sulfur and phosphorus-containing gases rising from the planet's warmer interior. Jupiter's fast rotation – spinning once every 10 hours – creates strong jet streams, separating its clouds into dark belts and bright zones across long stretches.\nWith no solid surface to slow them down, Jupiter's spots can persist for\n\n## From: Solar_System\n boil away because incredibly high pressure keeps it locked inside. Surface Neptune does not have a solid surface. Its atmosphere (made up mostly of hydrogen, helium, and methane) extends to great depths, gradually merging into water and other melted ices over a heavier, solid core with about the same mass as Earth. Atmosphere Neptune's atmosphere is made up mostly of hydrogen and helium with just a little bit of methane. Neptune's neighbor Uranus has a similar makeup; the methane absorbs other colors but reflects blue, giving these ice giants their similar hue. Many images of Neptune, coming from the Voyager 2 flyby in 1989, show Neptune as a much deeper blue. This was because the Voyager team tweaked the images, to better reveal clouds and other distinctive features on the planet, compared to the hazy, uniform view of Uranus that Voyager 2 had captured in 1986. Researchers in 2024 re-processed the images , showing the planets look much more alike than many thought.\nNeptune is our solar system's windiest world. Despite its great distance and low energy input from the Sun, Neptune's winds can be three times stronger than Jupiter's and nine times stronger than Earth's. These winds whip clouds of frozen methane across the planet at speeds of more than 1,200 miles per hour (2,000 kilometers per hour). Even Earth's most powerful winds hit only about 250 miles per hour (400 kilometers per hour).\nIn 1989 a large, oval-shaped storm in Neptune's southern hemisphere dubbed the \"Great Dark Spot\" was large enough to contain the entire Earth. That storm has since disappeared, but new ones have appeared on different parts of the planet. Magnetosphere The main axis of Neptune's magnetic field is tipped over by about 47 degrees compared with the planet's rotation axis. Like Uranus, whose magnetic axis is tilted about 60 degrees from the axis of rotation, Neptune's magnetosphere undergoes wild variations during each rotation because of this misalignment. The magnetic field\n\n## From: Solar_System\n the solar system (even bigger than the planet Mercury). Callisto’s very few small craters indicate a small degree of current surface activity. A liquid-water ocean with the ingredients for life may lie beneath the frozen crust of Europa, the target of NASA's Europa Clipper mission slated to launch in 2024. \n› More on Jupiter's Moons Rings Discovered in 1979 by NASA's Voyager 1 spacecraft, Jupiter's rings were a surprise. The rings are composed of small, dark particles, and they are difficult to see except when backlit by the Sun. Data from the Galileo spacecraft indicate that Jupiter's ring system may be formed by dust kicked up as interplanetary meteoroids smash into the giant planet's small innermost moons. Formation Jupiter took shape along with rest of the solar system about 4.6 billion years ago. Gravity pulled swirling gas and dust together to form this gas giant. Jupiter took most of the mass left over after the formation of the Sun, ending up with more than twice the combined material of the other bodies in the solar system. In fact, Jupiter has the same ingredients as a star, but it did not grow massive enough to ignite.\nAbout 4 billion years ago, Jupiter settled into its current position in the outer solar system, where it is the fifth planet from the Sun. Structure The composition of Jupiter is similar to that of the Sun – mostly hydrogen and helium. Deep in the atmosphere, pressure and temperature increase, compressing the hydrogen gas into a liquid. This gives Jupiter the largest ocean in the solar system – an ocean made of hydrogen instead of water. Scientists think that, at depths perhaps halfway to the planet's center, the pressure becomes so great that electrons are squeezed off the hydrogen atoms, making the liquid electrically conducting like metal. Jupiter's fast rotation is thought to drive electrical currents in this region, with the spinning of the liquid metallic hydrogen acting like a dynamo, generating the planet's powerful magnetic field. \n\n\n## From: Solar_System\n282,000 kilometers) from the planet, yet the vertical height is typically about 30 feet (10 meters) in the main rings. Named alphabetically in the order they were discovered, the rings are relatively close to each other, with the exception of a gap measuring 2,920 miles (4,700 kilometers) in width called the Cassini Division that separates Rings A and B. The main rings are A, B, and C. Rings D, E, F, and G are fainter and more recently discovered.\nStarting at Saturn and moving outward, there is the D ring, C ring, B ring, Cassini Division, A ring, F ring, G ring, and finally, the E ring. Much farther out, there is the very faint Phoebe ring in the orbit of Saturn's moon Phoebe. Formation Saturn took shape when the rest of the solar system formed about 4.5 billion years ago when gravity pulled swirling gas and dust in to become this gas giant. About 4 billion years ago, Saturn settled into its current position in the outer solar system, where it is the sixth planet from the Sun. Like Jupiter, Saturn is mostly made of hydrogen and helium, the same two main components that make up the Sun. Structure Like Jupiter, Saturn is made mostly of hydrogen and helium. At Saturn's center is a dense core of metals like iron and nickel surrounded by rocky material and other compounds solidified by intense pressure and heat. It is enveloped by liquid metallic hydrogen inside a layer of liquid hydrogen –similar to Jupiter's core but considerably smaller.\nIt's hard to imagine, but Saturn is the only planet in our solar system with an average density that is less than water. The giant gas planet could float in a bathtub if such a colossal thing existed. Surface As a gas giant, Saturn doesn’t have a true surface. The planet is mostly swirling gases and liquids deeper down. While a spacecraft would have nowhere to land on\n\n## From: Solar_System\n that wrap around the planet. Strong east-west winds moving in opposite directions separate the bands. Juno previously discovered that these winds, or jet streams, reach depths of about 2,000 miles (roughly 3,200 kilometers). Researchers are still trying to solve the mystery of how the jet streams form. Data collected by Juno during multiple passes reveal one possible clue: that the atmosphere’s ammonia gas travels up and down in remarkable alignment with the observed jet streams.\nJuno’s data also shows that the belts and zones undergo a transition around 40 miles (65 kilometers) beneath Jupiter’s water clouds. At shallow depths, Jupiter’s belts are brighter in microwave light than the neighboring zones. But at deeper levels, below the water clouds, the opposite is true – which reveals a similarity to our oceans. Polar Cyclones Juno previously discovered polygonal arrangements of giant cyclonic storms at both of Jupiter’s poles – eight arranged in an octagonal pattern in the north and five arranged in a pentagonal pattern in the south. Over time, mission scientists determined these atmospheric phenomena are extremely resilient, remaining in the same location.\nJuno data also indicates that, like hurricanes on Earth, these cyclones want to move poleward, but cyclones located at the center of each pole push them back. This balance explains where the cyclones reside and the different numbers at each pole. Magnetosphere The Jovian magnetosphere is the region of space influenced by Jupiter's powerful magnetic field. It balloons 600,000 to 2 million miles (1 to 3 million kilometers) toward the Sun (seven to 21 times the diameter of Jupiter itself) and tapers into a tadpole-shaped tail extending more than 600 million miles (1 billion kilometers) behind Jupiter, as far as Saturn's orbit. Jupiter's enormous magnetic field is 16 to 54 times as powerful as that of the Earth. It rotates with the planet and sweeps up particles that have an electric charge\n\n## From: Solar_System\n a moon just inward from the ring, stabilizes these arcs.\nName| Distance from Planet's Center| Radial Width ---|---|--- Galle| ~26,000 miles (41,900 kilometers)| 9.3 miles (15 kilometers) Leverrier| ~33,100 miles (53,200 kilometers)| 9.3 miles (15 kilometers) Lassell| ~34,400 miles (55,400 kilometers)| - Arago| ~35,800 miles (57,600 kilometers)| - Adams| ~39,100 miles (62,930 kilometers)| < 31 miles (50 kilometers) Liberté (Arc)| ~39,100 miles (62,900 kilometers)| - Egalité (Arc)| ~39,100 miles (62,900 kilometers)| - Fraternité (Arc)| ~39,100 miles (62,900 kilometers)| - Courage (Arc)| ~39,100 miles (62,900 kilometers)| - Source: U.S. Geological Survey, Gazetteer of Planetary Nomenclature, Planetary Names: Ring and Ring Gap Nomenclature, https://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/Page/Rings. Formation Neptune took shape when the rest of the solar system formed about 4.5 billion years ago when gravity pulled swirling gas and dust in to become this ice giant. Like its neighbor Uranus, Neptune likely formed closer to the Sun and moved to the outer solar system about 4 billion years ago. Structure Neptune is one of two ice giants in the outer solar system (the other is Uranus). Most (80% or more) of the planet's mass is made up of a hot dense fluid of \"icy\" materials – water, methane, and ammonia – above a small, rocky core.

        "expected_output": "Based on the provided texts, the five dwarf planets exhibit distinct characteristics and locations. Ceres is unique as the only one located in the inner solar system's asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter; it is the largest object in the belt, comprises 25% of its mass, was visited by the Dawn spacecraft, has a layered interior possibly including a water ice mantle and salt deposits on its rocky crust, but lacks moons and rings. The other four – Pluto, Haumea, Makemake, and Eris – reside in the Kuiper Belt beyond Neptune. Pluto, explored by New Horizons, is about half the width of the U.S., possesses mountains, valleys, plains, and craters, has a nitrogen-methane-carbon monoxide atmosphere that varies with solar distance, and has five moons, with the largest, Charon, forming a notable double system. Haumea is distinguished by its oval shape caused by rapid rotation (a 4-hour day), is composed of rock with an ice coating, has two moons (Hi'iaka and Namaka), and is the only dwarf planet mentioned with confirmed rings. Makemake, slightly smaller than Pluto and reddish-brown, features frozen methane and ethane on its surface, has one small provisional moon (MK 2), and its discovery contributed significantly to the planet redefinition debate. Eris is similar in size to Pluto but much more distant (average 68 AU), played a pivotal role alongside Makemake in the planet definition controversy, has one small moon (Dysnomia), a likely rocky surface, and an atmosphere that freezes and thaws during its 557-year orbit. All four Kuiper Belt dwarf planets are described as miniature icy worlds formed early in the solar system's history.",

The word goes back to the ancient Greek word planēt, and it means \"wanderer.\" A more modern definition can be found in the Merriam-Webster dictionary which defines a planet as \"any of the large bodies that revolve around the Sun in the solar system.\"\nIn 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) - a group of astronomers that names objects in our solar system - agreed on their own definition of the word \"planet.\" This new definition changed caused Pluto's famous \"demotion\" to a dwarf planet.

It takes about 305 Earth years for this dwarf planet to make one trip around the Sun.\nMakemake holds an important place in the history of solar system studies because it was one of the objects – along with Eris – whose discovery prompted the International Astronomical Union to reconsider the definition of a planet, and to create the new group of dwarf planets.\nMakemake was first observed in March 2005 by M.E. Brown, C.A. Trujillo, and D.L. Rabinowitz at the Palomar Observatory, California. Its unofficial codename was Easterbunny, Brown said, \"in honor of the fact that it was discovered just a few days past Easter.\" Before this dwarf planet was confirmed, its provisional name was 2005 FY9. In 2016, NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope spotted a small, dark moon orbiting Makemake. Namesake Makemake was named after the Rapanui god of fertility.

Pluto, Eris, and other similar objects are now classified as dwarf planets.\nEris was discovered on Jan. 5, 2005, from data obtained on Oct. 21, 2003, during a Palomar Observatory survey of the outer solar system by Mike Brown, a professor of planetary astronomy at the California Institute of Technology; Chad Trujillo of the Gemini Observatory; and David Rabinowitz of Yale University. Here are some key dates in the discovery of Eris:\n  * Jan 8, 2005: Scientists announce they have discovered a Pluto-sized world billions of miles beyond the orbit of Neptune. They nickname the tiny world Xena after a fictional television character. The discovery reignites a debate about the definition of a planet.\n  * Sep 2005: Scientists announce Xena has a tiny moon, which they nickname Gabriella after Xena's sidekick on a television show about a warrior princess.\n  * Aug 26, 2006: After months of debate about how to classify Eris, the International Astronomical Union\n\n## From: Solar_System\n planet pass in front of a star.

This distant realm is populated with thousands of miniature icy worlds which formed early in the history of our solar system about 4.5 billion years ago. These icy, rocky bodies are called Kuiper Belt objects, transneptunian objects, or plutoids. Structure Astronomers believe Haumea is made of rock with a coating of ice.
