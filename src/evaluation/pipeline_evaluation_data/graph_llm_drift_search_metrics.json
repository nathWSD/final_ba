        "expected_output": "The first Kuiper Belt Object (KBO) discovered was Pluto in 1930, though it wasn't initially recognized as part of a larger population due to its size and brightness relative to later discoveries and the lack of expectation for such a belt. Gerard Kuiper speculated about objects beyond Pluto in 1951, lending his name to the region (sometimes also called the Edgeworth-Kuiper Belt). Kenneth Edgeworth also mentioned such objects in the 1940s. Significant progress occurred in 1992 when David Jewitt and Jane Luu used a large telescope on Mauna Kea equipped with a CCD camera to discover the second KBO, 1992 QB1 (later named Albion). This technological advancement opened the door to finding thousands more KBOs. The first spacecraft to enter the region was Pioneer 10 in 1983, crossing beyond Neptune's orbit. However, NASA's New Horizons was the first mission to visit a KBO, flying past Pluto and its moons in July 2015. It then performed the most distant flyby in history, visiting the KBO Arrokoth (discovered in 2014 using the Hubble Space Telescope) on January 1, 2019, revealing it to be a contact binary and the most primitive object explored by spacecraft.",
        "retrieval_context": "## Detailed Evidence from Sources\n### Context related to: SUN (Top Chunk Score: 0.850)\n David Jewitt and Jane Luu attached a CCD camera to a large (2.2-meter) telescope on Mauna Kea in Hawaii, and they quickly detected an object, which was designated 1992 QB1, and later named Albion. Many more discoveries soon followed, with a couple of thousand KBOs being detected over the next quarter-century.\nThe first spacecraft to enter the Kuiper Belt region was NASA's Pioneer 10 spacecraft when it crossed into the space beyond Neptune's orbit in 1983. But the first spacecraft to visit an object in the Kuiper Belt was New Horizons when it flew by Pluto and its moons. New Horizons then went on to visit Arrokoth.\nTwo moons of the giant planets are thought to potentially be objects originally from the Kuiper Belt that became captured long ago. Neptune's largest moon Triton was visited by NASA's Voyager 2 spacecraft in 1989, while Phoebe, a small outer moon of Saturn, was visited by NASA's Cassini spacecraft in 2004. Both of these potential captured Kuiper Belt objects orbit their planets in a direction opposite of the other moons and the planet's rotation, which is a strong indication that they likely were captured objects that strayed too close to the planets.

On Jan. 1, 2019, the spacecraft flew by a Kuiper Belt object later named Arrokoth . In a fitting tribute to the farthest flyby ever conducted by spacecraft, the Kuiper Belt object designated 2014 MU69 was officially named Arrokoth, a Native American term meaning “sky” in the Powhatan/Algonquian language. - More about Arrokoth NASA/Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory/Southwest Research Institute//Roman\n### Context related to: FIRST ROBOTICS 2025 (Top Chunk Score: 0.839)\n Highlights 2 min readHubble Images a Peculiar Spiralarticle3 days ago 6 min readNASA’s Juno Mission Gets Under Jupiter’s and Io’s Surfacearticle5 days ago 6 min readWhat’s Up: May 2025 Skywatching Tips from NASAarticle3 days ago Back Missions Search All NASA Missions A to Z List of Missions Upcoming Launches and Landings Spaceships and Rockets Communicating with Missions Artemis James Webb Space Telescope Hubble Space Telescope International Space Station OSIRIS-REx Humans in Space Why Go to Space Astronauts Commercial Space Destinations Spaceships and Rockets Living in Space Earth Explore Earth Science Climate Change Earth, Our Planet Earth Science in Action Earth Multimedia Earth Data Earth Science Researchers The Solar System The Sun Mercury Venus Earth The Moon Mars Jupiter Saturn Uranus Neptune Pluto & Dwarf Planets Asteroids, Comets & Meteors The Kuiper Belt The Oort Cloud Skywatching The Universe Exoplanets The Search for Life in the Universe Stars Galaxies Black Holes The Big Bang Dark Matter Dark Energy Science Earth Science Planetary Science Astrophysics & Space Science The Sun & Heliophysics Biological & Physical Sciences Lunar Science Citizen Science Astromaterials Aeronautics Research Human Space Travel Research Aeronautics Science in the Air NASA Aircraft Flight Innovation Supersonic Flight Air Traffic Solutions Green Aviation Tech Drones & You Technology Technology Transfer & Spinoffs Space Travel Technology Technology Living in Space Manufacturing and Materials Robotics Science Instruments Computing Learning Resources For Kids and Students For Educators For Colleges and Universities For Professionals Science for Everyone Requests for Exhibits, Artifacts, or Speakers STEM Engagement at NASA About NASA NASA's Impacts Centers and Facilities Directorates Organizations People of NASA Careers Internships Our History Doing Business with NASA Get Involved Contact NASA en Español Ciencia Aeronáutica Ciencias Terrestres Sistema Solar Universo News & Events Recently Published Video Series\n. Astronomers think there are millions of small, icy objects in this region – including hundreds of thousands that are larger than 60 miles (100 kilometers) wide. Some of the objects, including Pluto, are over 600 miles (1,000 kilometers) wide. In addition to rock and water ice, objects in the Kuiper Belt also contain a variety of other frozen compounds like ammonia and methane.\nSimilar to the asteroid belt, the Kuiper Belt is a region of leftovers from the solar system's early history. Like the asteroid belt, it has also been shaped by a giant planet, although it's more of a thick disk (like a donut) than a thin belt.\nThe Kuiper Belt shouldn't be confused with the Oort Cloud, which is a much more distant region of icy, comet-like bodies that surrounds the solar system, including the Kuiper Belt. Both the Oort Cloud and the Kuiper Belt are thought to be sources of comets.\nThe Kuiper Belt is truly a frontier in space – it's a place we're still just beginning to explore and our understanding is still evolving. Namesake The region is named for astronomer Gerard Kuiper, who published a scientific paper in 1951 that speculated about objects beyond Pluto. Astronomer Kenneth Edgeworth also mentioned objects beyond Pluto in papers he published in the 1940s, and thus it's sometimes referred to as the Edgeworth-Kuiper Belt. Some researchers prefer to call it the Trans-Neptunian Region, and refer to Kuiper Belt objects (KBOs) as trans-Neptunian objects, or TNOs.\nWhatever your preferred term is, the belt occupies an enormous volume in our solar system, and the small worlds that inhabit it have a lot to tell us about early history. These two multiple-exposure images from NASA's Hubble Space Telescope show Kuiper Belt objects, or KBOs\n Science Aeronautics Technology Learning Resources About NASA Español News & Events Multimedia NASA+ Highlights 2 min readHubble Images a Peculiar Spiralarticle3 days ago 6 min readNASA’s Juno Mission Gets Under Jupiter’s and Io’s Surfacearticle5 days ago 6 min readWhat’s Up: May 2025 Skywatching Tips from NASAarticle3 days ago Back Missions Search All NASA Missions A to Z List of Missions Upcoming Launches and Landings Spaceships and Rockets Communicating with Missions Artemis James Webb Space Telescope Hubble Space Telescope International Space Station OSIRIS-REx Humans in Space Why Go to Space Astronauts Commercial Space Destinations Spaceships and Rockets Living in Space Earth Explore Earth Science Climate Change Earth, Our Planet Earth Science in Action Earth Multimedia Earth Data Earth Science Researchers The Solar System The Sun Mercury Venus Earth The Moon Mars Jupiter Saturn Uranus Neptune Pluto & Dwarf Planets Asteroids, Comets & Meteors The Kuiper Belt The Oort Cloud Skywatching The Universe Exoplanets The Search for Life in the Universe Stars Galaxies Black Holes The Big Bang Dark Matter Dark Energy Science Earth Science Planetary Science Astrophysics & Space Science The Sun & Heliophysics Biological & Physical Sciences Lunar Science Citizen Science Astromaterials Aeronautics Research Human Space Travel Research Aeronautics Science in the Air NASA Aircraft Flight Innovation Supersonic Flight Air Traffic Solutions Green Aviation Tech Drones & You Technology Technology Transfer & Spinoffs Space Travel Technology Technology Living in Space Manufacturing and Materials Robotics Science Instruments Computing Learning Resources For Kids and Students For Educators For Colleges and Universities For Professionals Science for Everyone Requests for Exhibits, Artifacts, or Speakers STEM Engagement at NASA About NASA NASA's Impacts Centers and Facilities Directorates Organizations People of NASA Careers Internships Our History Doing Business with NASA Get Involved Contact NASA en Español Ciencia Aeronáutica",

These missions study planets (Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, etc.), moons, asteroids (Bennu, Psyche, Vesta, etc.), comets, the Sun, and the outer reaches like the Kuiper Belt and Oort Cloud. Human spaceflight, centered around the Artemis program, aims for lunar presence (Lunar Space Station module, prepping for Moon landings with hybrid rocket motors) and potentially Mars. Technological development is crucial, focusing on areas like spacesuits (icy chamber tests), propulsion (hybrid rockets, solar-electric for Psyche), communication (ultralight antennas), power (innovative batteries, Power to Explore Challenge), aircraft technology (thin-wing concepts, X-59 supersonic flight), navigation, and instruments for remote sensing and analysis. Scientific goals span understanding planetary formation (via asteroids like Psyche), searching for life (a key driver, though currently only known on Earth), studying Earth's climate and environment (wildfire data, snowmelt tracking), exploring the universe's origins and composition (Big Bang, dark matter/energy), and ensuring planetary defense (tracking NEOs like 2024 YR4 via CNEOS).
